# SI507-final-project
This is the final project for SI 507


## Project Overview

For this project, I focused on laptops sold on BestBuy website. The main intention I want to do is to get the laptop
information from Bestbuy and store it into a well-designed database. My laptop database will provide an interface for users to use
simple commands to search for information that they want to know. I also tried to allow users to compare diï¬€erent laptops by
providing visualizations on laptops.

In terms of data, I used Python modules Requests and Beautifulsoup to crawl the data for laptops on BestBuy, especially parameters for each laptop. Due to the storage, I only selected four brands for the laptops, they are Apple, Microsoft Surface, HP and Dell. The crawling task covers pages with different hierarchies and  I needed to do some data analysis for my database including sorting, categorization,
etc. 

Anyone who wants to purchase or know the information of laptops would be one of my targeted populations. I would like my
work, fnally, to simulate an e-commerce website and provide more convenience to users.
