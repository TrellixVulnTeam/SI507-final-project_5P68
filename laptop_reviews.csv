I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the chance on hating it (since its so expensive) just to have the added perks of all of my devices connecting together. However, after hearing enough good reviews from friends I decided to switch and it was the best decision! It is such a nice computer. I love the slimness of it as well as the speed and applications. It sure is nice to have all of my devices connected together as well! I would say that the only downside is how expensive it was but I would have to say that it is worth it."", 'I bought the new 2019 macbook pro with touch bar. I have a windows 10 laptop with much higher specs but this mac never feels slow and weak in terms of performance as compared to it. Its a solid performer for everyday usage. you will never be disappointed in playing back any type of media, little video editing and some games and office work. solid machine.\n\nas this machine as only two 2 usb c ports, i bought a usb c hub to plug external monitor or normal usb drives, but hardly used it. It has got usb c charging so it can be charged with compatible charges and even power banks, perfect machine for those long drives and vacations. easily gives me 8+hrs of backup on battery in normal office products and working for office. Tight integration between apple products is another positive.\n\nmy previous 2011 mac air is still functioning like new, and hope to get few good years with this powerhouse as well.', ""I switched from using a windows laptop to buying an Apple MacBook Pro.  I researched it carefully and the advantages outweighed the disadvantages.  I was so disappointed in my last laptop purchase only 2 YEARS AGO (slow processor, laptop freezing, constantly calling Geek Squad, etc), I decided to invest in a RELIABLE laptop that had great reviews. There was a bit of a learning curve going from Windows to IOS, but that's what's getting me excited about this laptop.  It's quick and the storage is more than sufficient for home use (256gb).  So far, this is the BEST laptop purchase that is worth every penny!"", ""I've used the laptop for a week and I am blown away. Performance, screen, battery life, and build quality are all exceptional. If you have never owned a MacBook and you're looking to jump in, now is the perfect time at $1,199 or $1,399 with the discount. This is the best value MacBook for the performance you're getting in a long time. \n\nThe lower price point for the 2017 Pro looks enticing, but I would avoid it if you can. The 2019 Pro gets a bump to a quad-core processor 8th gen from the 2017's outdated 7th gen dual-core. You also get a Touch Bar and Touch ID, something you previously had to spend $500 more to get. I know some people really don't like the keyboard or Touch Bar, and I can certainly understand why. \n\nApple refreshed the butterfly keyboard (4th gen now) to make it more reliable and quieter. I find the typing experience to be unique but not my first choice.\n\nWith 8 GB of RAM and the i5, this computer blazes through all of my everyday tasks (which honestly are nothing special). Don't let the base clock 1.4 GHz fool you -- its speed varies on the task. I strongly recommend you spend the extra $200 and bump up to the 256 GB model. 128 GB is unacceptable in 2019, and you'll be begging for storage within a year. \n\nIf you have owned a Pro in the past, you know what to expect here. Switching from Windows and with an iPhone XR, the interaction between your Apple devices is seamless. There's a bit of a learning curve with macOS, but if you're a content creator or just someone who is looking for a premium laptop experience, this is the way to go. Great job Apple!"", 'It is a great personal computer. Went with the touch bar and 256gb because it was on sale. Definitely go with more storage because nowadays to back up your phone you will need at least 128gb. The color displays are great and the machine can run multiple apps at once without a hitch.  The USB attachment is sold separately though I feel that for the price it should have been included because the attachment is not cheap and you need it since there is nowhere to plug in you phone or iPad if you are a cables person but I see how they are pushing their cloud.', 'I was very nervous about purchasing a MacBook Pro since I’ve been using an HP laptop the past few years. However, since teachers use MacBooks in many schools I wanted to give it a try! I really like my Pro and highly recommend it. It’s very fast and quiet.

I am very happy with my purchasing since I saved $200 during the back to school sale.', ""I have always wanted a macbook and this is everything I have ever wanted. I am going to college in a few weeks and cannot wait to use it to its potential. I plan on going for Finance, so I don't need anything super intense.

That’s all it is though - Good. The 2019 MacBook Air is just a general refresh of the 2018 Model with a few key differences. The first difference is True Tone display. It’s a technology that’s nice to have but it isn’t essential. Truth be told, you’re not missing too much here so if you opt for last years model which should be cheaper now, you’re ok. The last change is with the keyboard. Apple has once again tweaked the keyboard for better ingress protection to prevent any keyboard issues. So far I’ve had none, but we will see how this goes long term. \n\nEverything else remains the same - the processor, GPU, Configurations and all of that. This is not a bad thing though. This computer is great at day to day tasks and is super fast. It can handle multiple tasks at once and has the smoothness that MacOS is known for - you click it and it’s there. \n\nNeedless to say, this machine would be great for students and light to medium users. The battery life is great and general performance is good, but power users should look to the MacBook Pro. Video editing and heavy photoshop can be ehhh with the iGPU. Of course, you do have external solutions, if the i5 is sufficient for you. \n\nOverall, it’s a great computer. I didn’t have a good experience with it due to some hardware issues but I can wholeheartedly say it’s a great product.

The Apple rep said that this meant the latest security updates would no longer be installed. SO, I decided to break down and buy this model. It uses USB-C ports so if you have accessories like thumb drives, you will need to get an adapter to plug them in, which I got.

I would recommend this over any other laptop out right now but get more space up front! \r\n\r\nOn to the good stuff \r\n\r\n-performance - I decided to get the base Touch Bar model that just came out because I wanted to see if the 8GB of ram plus those new processors would do what I needed it to do. I just have to say it hasn\'t let me down yet and I was surprised, I use this for video editing and photo editing, along with other graphics art projects and even with many things open it does very well and only gets a little warm when exporting video. I use this thing all the time and the one thing I wish is more hard drive space I haven\'t even noticed it being slow at all with the lower specs and thats saying something because I normally get the 15"" MacBook Pro\'s but when going from 2015 model I never felt the need to upgrade till this year and the time is right specs wise.\r\n\r\n- build quality - So I really enjoy the size and quality of this laptop and I know there have been all sorts of things negative about the new MacBooks but I really like this new keyboard and its a dream to type on ( for me at least go test one in store for your self ) this is a big improvement if you ask me over last year. then the chassis and screen all seem to be nice sturdy and great build quality I have not found another laptop that I feel has this same quality build wise.\r\n\r\n- size - Ok I know everyone wants small and smaller but I think that if these things got any smaller for my pro machine I wouldn\'t want it. This thing will fit anywhere and having the 13"" with this much power is great and I can use it places I never would before. \r\n\r\n-screen - Im not that big into no bezels like everyone else I would prefer sturdy non breaking screen over a full display any day. But this is on par with what you expect from apple it works and looks beautiful along with the new color match stuff built in to color correct in different lighting ( I turn this off for photo and video editing ). Also this doesn\'t just flip down on me when I move around and it doesn\'t have a ton of shake that you see in a lot of small form factor laptops, again this part feels sturdy.\r\n\r\n- Touch Bar - I love the computer but this I could live with or with out it ... I mean it does provide use and can make selecting things faster and I don\'t really like touch screen laptops so this is a good alternative. But you would have to make your self learn to use it and sometimes it might be easier to move the mouse sometimes its better to leave your hands and select on the Touch Bar ( but I would like the buttons back they moved like esc, just incase ) \r\n\r\n- Mouse - I see some saying its to big and takes up to much space but this is the only laptop I have found I like to work with out an external mouse and it feels weird to me when you go to other computers in the house and their mouse is so tiny and can\'t move screen edge to edge. Then I have not had any problems hitting it while I type and I even made it a point to keep my palms down when I type and still nothing, check that for your self because it could be different with different people. But this part makes working easier and feels very nice to use and touch.\r\n\r\n- ports - Just have to say it but the ports could at times slow you down a little but I really haven\'t noticed any differences and I just buy things for the USB C and they work and they are fast. Hasn\'t been a problem and if you need the device for the power and can afford it I would say get it and grab a few USB C things like SD reader and a few adapters till you get swapped out or just incase and you will be just fine! One little thing when doing things with this SSD and USB C storage things move around pretty quick like photo files ( maybe its a good thing but I would have liked one USB or SD port lol ) \r\n\r\nOver all I am happy I waited till 2018 to upgrade my personal machine and I think this is the time to get a MacBook Pro because I think the look and hardware are better now than in the last few editions. I would recommend and do enjoy this laptop, I will be getting an external screen for home use and screen size and the external hard drive.

If you are considering this 16"" then you should totally buy one, I love mine.', 'The engineers at Apple have finally engineered a marvel.  Using bleeding edge technology from (checks notes) 2013, Apple has finally released a new notebook that comes with an actual keyboard.  The new keyboard is basically the same as the stand along keyboard that Apple sells with an iMac, and it\'s a great typing experience.  The keyboard is the standout ""old"" feature, but the rest of the device is solid.  The 16"" screen is big and beautiful.  The thermal properties have in fact been improved, which lets you actually get mileage from the 8 core i9 CPU.  I would caution that being locked into using Catalina brings its own set of issues, the most notable being the dropping of support for 32 bit apps, such as Aperture.  It also by default enforces a strict software signing policy on 3rd party apps, which can be turned off, but to turn it off requires running commands in terminal.  It can be a source of considerable pain if you\'re migrating from a device with an older version of MacOS.  All that being said, the device itself is actually fantastic.  I know the review sounds a bit negative, but the truth is that this a great notebook that is finally a worthy upgrade to my 2013 MacBook Pro.  I just don\'t want to get too carried away handing out praise for finally going back to the ""good"" keyboard they already had 6 years ago.  :)\n\nQuality: 5/5 -- this device is well built and premium\n\nValue: 3/5 -- the thing has an 8 core i9.  It\'s a premium product with a price tag to match.  There are in fact better bang for the buck values.  But if you need/want the horses....\n\nEase of Use: 4/5 -- it\'s a Mac.  It generally just works.  And when it just works, it is great.  But Catalina has some design decisions that are going to be painful for some migrating users in terms of deprecating support for older apps, so I have to dock a point here.', 'This is a great upgrade from the 15.4"" model. Going up to 16"" may not sound like a big deal, but the smaller bezel and the addt\'l real estate makes for a much more immersive experience albeit with the penalty of a heavier and bulkier laptop.  The screen is excellent (on par with other recent MBPs).  The keyboard is definitely improved, with more travel and a better overall feel. The keys no longer feel ""flat"" and clacky.  The speakers and mic are a huge improvement.  I\'m very impressed with the depth of sound from 10 to 80%; once you get above 80% volume a little distortion starts to creep out.  \n\nThis 1 TB model seems to be the price sweet spot.  Start adding more memory or hdd space, and the price can skyrocket. This model runs Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro without a hitch.  The body of the laptop (including the touch pad) stay noticeably cooler than my 13"" MBP.  \n\nOverall, this is a nice laptop.  I still do think, however, that the Microsoft Surface line overall is a better value. At nearly $3,000, it\'s kind of hard to understand what you\'re getting.  I think the answer is that the high price tag is the price of being in the Apple ecosystem; almost like an access fee.  \n\nIf you love the Apple ecosystem OS X, then this is a great laptop.  Not exactly a great travel companion due to the heft, but fine around the house, the office, or around town.', 'Got rid of my 2018 MBP 13” for the i9 16. While it is heavier and bigger to lug around the screen is absolutely immersive and a thing to behold.

Full-size keyboard is nice and a 4 ports are nice, as you can charge on either side. Using it with Apple TV and or another screen using the new sidecar function makes for a powerhouse for presentations and group work projects. In sum: best laptop out there for folks with $$ to spend.', 'As someone who’s owned both 13’ and 15’ MBP from the butterfly era (2019 13’ and 2017 15’) , I realized after using this machine how much the little quirks from those laptops annoyed me, and how fixing them with this model has made it a joy to use... \n\nFirst off the keyboard. The butterfly keyboard never grew on me. Usable? Yes. Enjoyable? Not if you’re typing for extended periods. My fingers always felt a little sore after a few pages. These feel cushy, springy, and just all around much more nice to type with. Honestly the new keyboard gets me a little too excited lol. \n\nSecond, the screen. You wouldn’t think .6 inches of added space would make a difference, but it does. The screen feels so much more modern and immersive and gives me more space to fit In documents and web pages without compromising their size. Also, I do feel like it is just a tad sharper than my previous 15’, even though it’s only 7 ppi more. Bright and colorful as always. \n\nMy other major factor with my previous 15 inch was battery. I would always have battery anxiety when out and about. Although it would last a respectable 6-7 hours depending on usage, the battery percentage would click down just a little too quickly for my liking, and it would always be at the back of my mind. This machine has alleviated that. No, it’s not as good as my old MacBook Air, but I definitely don’t check the percentage anymore. Even watching YouTube, writing documents, surfing the web, using Spotify, I get a comfortable 8-9 hours WITH about 75% brightness. \n\n\nFinally, the speakers. Oh the speakers. These are just *chef’s kiss* magnifique. Rich, nuances, loud, clean, I honestly can’t listen to music on another laptop after these. It’s ruined me. \n\nOverall I’m so pleased with Apple. I was always a fan, but this really solidified them in my mind as the premiere best all around manufacturer of laptops when considering the OS as well. AND the same starting price as original 15’ with more storage and updated almost all other internals?! Well worth the .3 lbs it adds to my backpack. \n\nIf you’re considering this and you have the cash, get it. Its honestly a no-brainer.', 'I am so happy they finally ditched the horrid, truly terrible butterfly keyboard and moved back to the scissor keyboard. There is a bit less travel on this new 2019 model than on my 2015 model (which I still love and am writing this review on), but it is a huge and welcome improvement. I love the new 16"" display as well, which is a real bonus. Apple is back with this laptop. I only wish they had done this with their 2019 update earlier this year, which I do have and is going for sale on eBay.', 'I have owned each iteration of the MBP 15 (as well as numerous PC laptops), since the 2016 release. The MBP 16 is easily the best of the MBP bunch and performance/dollar finally seems to be becoming more reasonable.\n\nFor the same price as the prior MBP 15, you now get:\n*** Better keyboard. This version is significantly more pleasant to type on and should leave the reliability issues of the butterfly keyboard behind.\n*** Better cooling. The laptop still runs hot, as do all with these CPUs, but it runs at higher clockspeed for longer. Depending on workload, I\'m usually seeing at least a 10-15% improvement in CPU performance\n*** Much better GPU. This was my primary reason for upgrading, the 5500m is MUCH faster than the 560x and even the Vega 20\n*** Better display and battery. For such a small increase in display size, it really feels more significant and is a great form factor. Battery life should also be slightly improved due to the larger 100WH battery, but I\'ve only had limited experience on battery at this time \n*** 1TB storage vs the prior model 512GB at this price point \n\nAll in all, while you are still paying an ""Apple Tax"", it at least feels that you are now getting performance and specs more in line with what you would expect for a $2700+ laptop.

I was able to sign in to all apps (including the 3 new entertainment ones that used to be iTunes).  When my software was upgraded to 10.15.1 (right before I could try enabling the 1 free year trial with TV+), I found I couldn't sign in to Apple TV, Music, or Podcast.  The main support agent I worked with said that she could find other incidents but that there wasn't a resolution yet.  I thought I might have to wait for another software update, but luckily found a suggestion on how to log out and kill iCloud.  After restarting, I could sign into the apps and then sign back into iCloud.  Viola! works now.  So there's that bug (from new software feature).  I've also noticed that if I try to airplay TV to an Apple TV device will just quit the application unexpectedly.  If I want to share my library or TV+ with others, I do find I can airplay 4K Dolby Vision and Atmos using an iPad Pro 12.9 I've just gotten.  Sidecar seems to work well for being able to use graphics apps with Apple pencil, though I can't calibrate the iPad while mirrored (my calibration program also quits unexpectedly.  Perhaps that's another iOS 13/ OS 10.15 bug to be resolved.  Anyway, some potential software issues are what's giving this a 4 star review.  As I said, I like the hardware: the i9 processor does offer significantly faster render times with videos compared to my Lenovo, and the fans aren't as loud.  My Lenovo might have fans going when even doing web surfing, but my Mac stays silent except really heavy loads."", ""It has been a while since I updated my computer, yet I am DELIGHTED that I have done so! I have been working on a friend's, but this one is so MUCH better! I am no longer jealous. I don't think I could have made a better choice. While I have owned Mac computers and taught people to use the same software on PCs,  nothing stands up to the awesomeness of a Mac. And this one is awesome! The speakers are great! The keyboard is easy touch and has reflective action to know you have touched & made the touch communicate. (I have touched some PC laptops which feel like they have the cheapest keyboard & I felt like I was using a typewriter from the early 1900's. Sucked.

5721726 ,"(""I am a longtime Windows fan, with Windows 10 being my favorite OS to date. In summary, I have seen the light. The MacBook Pro is the best laptop I have ever owned or used. Gaming aside, this is the best laptop you can get. Period.\r\n\r\nFor gaming, Windows 10 or a console are the way to go. I have a gaming PC and that is not going to change anytime soon. For personal use, however, my MacBook Pro is now my computer of choice. I bought a MacBook Air for my wife during Best Buy's $799 Black Friday promotion. She loves it for casual email and web surfing. I tried it out and it grew on me. Fast forward a few weeks and I decided to trade in my iPad Air and Apple Watch 1 and I initially tried a Surface Laptop. I returned it less than 24 hours later due to wifi issues and instead picked up this MacBook Pro at the holiday special price of $1149. I have used it extensively for about a month and here are the Pros and Cons.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Drop dead gorgeous screen, Retina cannot be beaten\r\n-Fast, the Core i5 CPU has no trouble keeping up\r\n-Good battery life, I generally can go 8-10 hours of hard use between charges\r\n-Wakes up quickly, just as fast as your iPhone or iPad\r\n-OSX has grown on me, its very intuitive once you get the hang of it\r\n-Oversized trackpad is cool, as is the haptic feedback you get when you press it\r\n-Laptop is very high quality, the aluminum feels and looks great, nothing feels cheap\r\n-Speakers are the best you can get on a laptop, plenty of volume and depth and even some bass\r\n-Not too heavy, it was in my backpack for a recent trip I took and it was fine as far as weight\r\n-Most content I used on my iPad is available on the Mac, including Zinio, iTunes movies and shows and Outlook app\r\n-Getting and sending text messages and making and receiving telephone calls on the MacBook is very handy, works so long as the iPhone is nearby \r\n-Did I mention the gorgeous Retina screen?\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-Keyboard travel is very short, it takes some time to get used to it\r\n-No Netflix app for Mac - whats up with that, they have an app for Windows 10\r\n-Power supply is big and buying a second one for your backpack for trips is expensive\r\n-Limited connectivity options, this model only has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports and a headphone jack\r\n-More powerful models can get pricey"", ""In a nutshell. the best premium laptops on the market currently are this and the Microsoft Surface laptop (although long reliability is still questionable as of yet for the Surface laptop), with that said, I leaning towards the Surface since I'm more familiar with Windows but based on research that showed how easy it is to convert to OS X (Apple Migrant Software) and Windows software like Google Drive, OneDrive and Office 365 works perfect on a Mac. This was a no brainer especially with sale and students discount,\r\nsince I mainly work in the cloud the small 128 gig SSD was not an issue and currently have 90 gigs of space open with all the apps I need for school and work installed.\r\n\r\n I been through many Windows laptop over the years and can tell you even some of other top ones like the Dell XPS, HP 360, Asus Zenbook will have some issues with quality over time, check the support forums. This is the main reason I joined the dark side and finally got an Apple product. How do I know this?

Even just browsing the web it was not a smooth experience and would get hot while using. This new model is substantially better than the 2015 version. Programs open fast, web browsing is great, battery life is great and the revised keyboard is fantastic to type on. I don\'t know exactly what Apple changed with the keyboard but this is more like typing on a MacBook Pro now and not quite like the flat original keys of the 2015 MacBook. I have not done any video conversion yet so I have no opinion on the processing speed.

I game a lot and I have a separate desktop for that. definitely this laptop is not for gaming. you can game probably at very low graphics but ports are an issue. it doesn't bother me since I bought this laptop for working at home to work by the window if i wanted toxD this meets my needs.

It’s honestly too smart for me and I have no idea how to use it, but so far I love it!', 'The product works flawlessly. Fast, accurate, impeccable fit and finish, compact....just beautiful. Pick one up and play with it....you Will buy one.', 'Since I made my first Mac purchase about eight or nine years ago, I have always owned a MacBook Pro. I owned 2010 and 2012 models. On this most recent purchase, however, I was going back and forth between buying the base model 12"" MacBook and the base model MacBook Pro 13"" model as their entry price are the same and they have different things to offer. I was very tempted to purchase the MacBook 12"" when I first saw it in store; I loved the size and loved the keyboard; however, I was concerned when I initially saw the specs that came along with the base model. As I considered my options, there was a flash sale hosted by Best Buy that I could not resist. The current (2017) MacBook\'s price was significantly decreased and, to save even more money, I found an open box, certified like new, deal on the same date. I figured that this was the perfect time to make up my mind and made the purchase. The computer arrived two days later. \r\n\r\nI immediately put the computer through its paces and tested its competence in completing the tasks I know I will put it through in the years to come (as I typically keep my Mac purchases a number of years before updating again). I was able to have the computer set up completely in 10-15 minutes. I did typical web searching and the computer handled this without lagging, even with multiple tabs. I simultaneously had multiple apps open at the same time, as I am a huge multitasker. The 8 GB memory makes this computer handle the multitasking with ease. I was able to have Calendar, App Store, Word, Messenger, Notes, Safari, and Photos running without any stuttering.\r\n\r\nNext, I downloaded iMovie and edited and exported a 4k video within the app . I understand that Macs and Mac software are optimized to work well together, but I was still quite surprised to see exactly how well this MacBook handled editing and exporting video This MacBook didn\'t only handle the editing with ease, but it actually seemed to export more quickly than my 2012 MacBoo Pro model did, which had a 2.9 i7 processor.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is definitely different from any keyboard I have used. I fell in love with it when I first played with it in store on a display model. I do not mind the shallow key travel as the clickiness of the keyboard makes typing on the machine a satisfying machine. I enjoy all MacBook keyboards, but I have already found out that I make fewer errors while typing on this MacBook\'s keyboard. \r\n\r\nI have always loved MacBook\'s trackpads and this one is my favorite. Clicking the trackpad actually feels like a real click. The trackpad seems to be quicker and more responsive than the trackpads I have had on my other MacBook Pro models and the size has increased for a more fluid experience. \r\n\r\nIn sum, this MacBook initially won me over by its small, sleek, well-put together appearance, but kept me loving it once I experienced its surprising power, its beautiful screen, accurate and pleasing keyboard, and the quick and easy to use track pad. So far, this MacBook is everything I dreamed it would be (beautiful screen, extremely portable, fun to type on, and capable of handling every day tasks) and then some (editing video with ease using iMovie and beautiful performance with multitasking). \r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this computer to anyone looking for a small and light computer that is also very capable. I do not do heavy movie editing, so a heavy user, or even a user not using software optimized for a Mac, would likely want to buy a Pro model MacBook to handle more intensive needs. However, for what I do, this computer is handling everything I need quite beautifully and I keep finding things to love about it when I feared I would feel the opposite.', 'This is not the fastest or most powerful laptop you can buy, not by far. If that\'s what you want and you want a Mac, a 15"" MacBook Pro is more your style. It\'s also not the cheapest laptop you can buy, and not even the cheapest Mac laptop. If that\'s what you want, look at the MacBook Air. So who is the 12"" MacBook for?\r\n- You travel regularly or often work on the go. The 12"" fits on an airplane tray table, even in coach, and the battery life is excellent when you\'re not near a power outlet.\r\n- You commute on foot, bike, or public transportation and carry your laptop on your back or shoulder. It\'s ridiculously lightweight and won\'t cause strain. It\'s only slightly bigger and heavier than the normal size iPad.\r\n- You have typical computing needs: web, email, social media, typical documents and spreadsheets, light photo and video editing (meaning that you view and edit photos and videos for yourself and your friends/family; you\'re not editing the next Hollywood blockbuster). For the tasks that 95% of people use a computer for, this laptop is perfectly capable.\r\n- You care about style. I lost count of the number of compliments I\'ve received about this computer.\r\n- Your budget affords an upgrade over the MacBook Air but you don\'t have the money and/or the computing need for a MacBook Pro.\r\n- You don\'t use a lot of external accessories. There is only one port (other than headphones) and it is USB-C. It\'s the same port that is used for charging, so if you work plugged in at a desk and need to also plug in an accessory or two, you\'re going to be swapping cords or you will need to buy a USB-C dock. If you still use USB-A (the old style of USB that\'s been around for 20+ years) accessories like thumb drives, you\'ll want to at least get an inexpensive USB-C to USB-A adapter. With pretty much everything going wireless and using the cloud for file access, I personally don\'t have a need to plug in anything but the power cord. If you do, the one port might be the achilles heel of this laptop.', '')"
5721723 ,"(""I am a longtime Windows fan, with Windows 10 being my favorite OS to date. In summary, I have seen the light. The MacBook Pro is the best laptop I have ever owned or used. Gaming aside, this is the best laptop you can get. Period.\r\n\r\nFor gaming, Windows 10 or a console are the way to go. I have a gaming PC and that is not going to change anytime soon. For personal use, however, my MacBook Pro is now my computer of choice. I bought a MacBook Air for my wife during Best Buy's $799 Black Friday promotion. She loves it for casual email and web surfing. I tried it out and it grew on me. Fast forward a few weeks and I decided to trade in my iPad Air and Apple Watch 1 and I initially tried a Surface Laptop. I returned it less than 24 hours later due to wifi issues and instead picked up this MacBook Pro at the holiday special price of $1149. I have used it extensively for about a month and here are the Pros and Cons.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Drop dead gorgeous screen, Retina cannot be beaten\r\n-Fast, the Core i5 CPU has no trouble keeping up\r\n-Good battery life, I generally can go 8-10 hours of hard use between charges\r\n-Wakes up quickly, just as fast as your iPhone or iPad\r\n-OSX has grown on me, its very intuitive once you get the hang of it\r\n-Oversized trackpad is cool, as is the haptic feedback you get when you press it\r\n-Laptop is very high quality, the aluminum feels and looks great, nothing feels cheap\r\n-Speakers are the best you can get on a laptop, plenty of volume and depth and even some bass\r\n-Not too heavy, it was in my backpack for a recent trip I took and it was fine as far as weight\r\n-Most content I used on my iPad is available on the Mac, including Zinio, iTunes movies and shows and Outlook app\r\n-Getting and sending text messages and making and receiving telephone calls on the MacBook is very handy, works so long as the iPhone is nearby \r\n-Did I mention the gorgeous Retina screen?\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-Keyboard travel is very short, it takes some time to get used to it\r\n-No Netflix app for Mac - whats up with that, they have an app for Windows 10\r\n-Power supply is big and buying a second one for your backpack for trips is expensive\r\n-Limited connectivity options, this model only has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports and a headphone jack\r\n-More powerful models can get pricey"", ""In a nutshell. the best premium laptops on the market currently are this and the Microsoft Surface laptop (although long reliability is still questionable as of yet for the Surface laptop), with that said, I leaning towards the Surface since I'm more familiar with Windows but based on research that showed how easy it is to convert to OS X (Apple Migrant Software) and Windows software like Google Drive, OneDrive and Office 365 works perfect on a Mac. This was a no brainer especially with sale and students discount,\r\nsince I mainly work in the cloud the small 128 gig SSD was not an issue and currently have 90 gigs of space open with all the apps I need for school and work installed.\r\n\r\n I been through many Windows laptop over the years and can tell you even some of other top ones like the Dell XPS, HP 360, Asus Zenbook will have some issues with quality over time, check the support forums.

5998400 ,"('I will start with the one thing I didn\'t like about this product and thats the hard drive space, this is a very fast laptop and the hard drive is fast as well but in 2018 -256GB is just not enough. I would recommend this over any other laptop out right now but get more space up front! \r\n\r\nOn to the good stuff \r\n\r\n-performance - I decided to get the base Touch Bar model that just came out because I wanted to see if the 8GB of ram plus those new processors would do what I needed it to do. I just have to say it hasn\'t let me down yet and I was surprised, I use this for video editing and photo editing, along with other graphics art projects and even with many things open it does very well and only gets a little warm when exporting video. I use this thing all the time and the one thing I wish is more hard drive space I haven\'t even noticed it being slow at all with the lower specs and thats saying something because I normally get the 15"" MacBook Pro\'s but when going from 2015 model I never felt the need to upgrade till this year and the time is right specs wise.\r\n\r\n- build quality - So I really enjoy the size and quality of this laptop and I know there have been all sorts of things negative about the new MacBooks but I really like this new keyboard and its a dream to type on ( for me at least go test one in store for your self ) this is a big improvement if you ask me over last year. then the chassis and screen all seem to be nice sturdy and great build quality I have not found another laptop that I feel has this same quality build wise.\r\n\r\n- size - Ok I know everyone wants small and smaller but I think that if these things got any smaller for my pro machine I wouldn\'t want it. This thing will fit anywhere and having the 13"" with this much power is great and I can use it places I never would before. \r\n\r\n-screen - Im not that big into no bezels like everyone else I would prefer sturdy non breaking screen over a full display any day. But this is on par with what you expect from apple it works and looks beautiful along with the new color match stuff built in to color correct in different lighting ( I turn this off for photo and video editing ). Also this doesn\'t just flip down on me when I move around and it doesn\'t have a ton of shake that you see in a lot of small form factor laptops, again this part feels sturdy.\r\n\r\n- Touch Bar - I love the computer but this I could live with or with out it ... I mean it does provide use and can make selecting things faster and I don\'t really like touch screen laptops so this is a good alternative. But you would have to make your self learn to use it and sometimes it might be easier to move the mouse sometimes its better to leave your hands and select on the Touch Bar ( but I would like the buttons back they moved like esc, just incase ) \r\n\r\n- Mouse - I see some saying its to big and takes up to much space but this is the only laptop I have found I like to work with out an external mouse and it feels weird to me when you go to other computers in the house and their mouse is so tiny and can\'t move screen edge to edge. Then I have not had any problems hitting it while I type and I even made it a point to keep my palms down when I type and still nothing, check that for your self because it could be different with different people. But this part makes working easier and feels very nice to use and touch.\r\n\r\n- ports - Just have to say it but the ports could at times slow you down a little but I really haven\'t noticed any differences and I just buy things for the USB C and they work and they are fast. Hasn\'t been a problem and if you need the device for the power and can afford it I would say get it and grab a few USB C things like SD reader and a few adapters till you get swapped out or just incase and you will be just fine! One little thing when doing things with this SSD and USB C storage things move around pretty quick like photo files ( maybe its a good thing but I would have liked one USB or SD port lol ) \r\n\r\nOver all I am happy I waited till 2018 to upgrade my personal machine and I think this is the time to get a MacBook Pro because I think the look and hardware are better now than in the last few editions. I would recommend and do enjoy this laptop, I will be getting an external screen for home use and screen size and the external hard drive.

Pick one up and play with it....you Will buy one.', 'Since I made my first Mac purchase about eight or nine years ago, I have always owned a MacBook Pro. I owned 2010 and 2012 models. On this most recent purchase, however, I was going back and forth between buying the base model 12"" MacBook and the base model MacBook Pro 13"" model as their entry price are the same and they have different things to offer. I was very tempted to purchase the MacBook 12"" when I first saw it in store; I loved the size and loved the keyboard; however, I was concerned when I initially saw the specs that came along with the base model. As I considered my options, there was a flash sale hosted by Best Buy that I could not resist. The current (2017) MacBook\'s price was significantly decreased and, to save even more money, I found an open box, certified like new, deal on the same date. I figured that this was the perfect time to make up my mind and made the purchase. The computer arrived two days later. \r\n\r\nI immediately put the computer through its paces and tested its competence in completing the tasks I know I will put it through in the years to come (as I typically keep my Mac purchases a number of years before updating again). I was able to have the computer set up completely in 10-15 minutes. I did typical web searching and the computer handled this without lagging, even with multiple tabs. I simultaneously had multiple apps open at the same time, as I am a huge multitasker. The 8 GB memory makes this computer handle the multitasking with ease. I was able to have Calendar, App Store, Word, Messenger, Notes, Safari, and Photos running without any stuttering.\r\n\r\nNext, I downloaded iMovie and edited and exported a 4k video within the app . I understand that Macs and Mac software are optimized to work well together, but I was still quite surprised to see exactly how well this MacBook handled editing and exporting video This MacBook didn\'t only handle the editing with ease, but it actually seemed to export more quickly than my 2012 MacBoo Pro model did, which had a 2.9 i7 processor.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is definitely different from any keyboard I have used. I fell in love with it when I first played with it in store on a display model. I do not mind the shallow key travel as the clickiness of the keyboard makes typing on the machine a satisfying machine. I enjoy all MacBook keyboards, but I have already found out that I make fewer errors while typing on this MacBook\'s keyboard. \r\n\r\nI have always loved MacBook\'s trackpads and this one is my favorite. Clicking the trackpad actually feels like a real click. The trackpad seems to be quicker and more responsive than the trackpads I have had on my other MacBook Pro models and the size has increased for a more fluid experience. \r\n\r\nIn sum, this MacBook initially won me over by its small, sleek, well-put together appearance, but kept me loving it once I experienced its surprising power, its beautiful screen, accurate and pleasing keyboard, and the quick and easy to use track pad. So far, this MacBook is everything I dreamed it would be (beautiful screen, extremely portable, fun to type on, and capable of handling every day tasks) and then some (editing video with ease using iMovie and beautiful performance with multitasking). \r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this computer to anyone looking for a small and light computer that is also very capable. I do not do heavy movie editing, so a heavy user, or even a user not using software optimized for a Mac, would likely want to buy a Pro model MacBook to handle more intensive needs. However, for what I do, this computer is handling everything I need quite beautifully and I keep finding things to love about it when I feared I would feel the opposite.', 'This is not the fastest or most powerful laptop you can buy, not by far. If that\'s what you want and you want a Mac, a 15"" MacBook Pro is more your style. It\'s also not the cheapest laptop you can buy, and not even the cheapest Mac laptop. If that\'s what you want, look at the MacBook Air. So who is the 12"" MacBook for?\r\n- You travel regularly or often work on the go. The 12"" fits on an airplane tray table, even in coach, and the battery life is excellent when you\'re not near a power outlet.\r\n- You commute on foot, bike, or public transportation and carry your laptop on your back or shoulder. It\'s ridiculously lightweight and won\'t cause strain. It\'s only slightly bigger and heavier than the normal size iPad.\r\n- You have typical computing needs: web, email, social media, typical documents and spreadsheets, light photo and video editing (meaning that you view and edit photos and videos for yourself and your friends/family; you\'re not editing the next Hollywood blockbuster). For the tasks that 95% of people use a computer for, this laptop is perfectly capable.\r\n- You care about style. I lost count of the number of compliments I\'ve received about this computer.\r\n- Your budget affords an upgrade over the MacBook Air but you don\'t have the money and/or the computing need for a MacBook Pro.\r\n- You don\'t use a lot of external accessories. There is only one port (other than headphones) and it is USB-C. It\'s the same port that is used for charging, so if you work plugged in at a desk and need to also plug in an accessory or two, you\'re going to be swapping cords or you will need to buy a USB-C dock. If you still use USB-A (the old style of USB that\'s been around for 20+ years) accessories like thumb drives, you\'ll want to at least get an inexpensive USB-C to USB-A adapter. With pretty much everything going wireless and using the cloud for file access, I personally don\'t have a need to plug in anything but the power cord. If you do, the one port might be the achilles heel of this laptop.', '')"

I originally purchased a Surface Laptop 2 and even tried a Surface Pro 6 and ended up taking them both back due to a variety of glitches. \r\n\r\nI heard that they were using a quad-core processor so I decided to give the 13"" MacBook Pro a chance, and for the first time in a while, only got 8GB of Ram. I have to say that I was stunned at the speed and performance; opening programs like Lightroom and Photoshop were a breeze, and the movements and clicks were smooth as silk. I routinely use multiple programs at once and it rarely stutters. On top of that, the size is small enough to fit into a small bag and it\'s design remains one of the most beautiful on the market.', 'This laptop does not have ports for camera or phone. You have to buy an extra external port. This laptop is good if you like Apple.

Bestbuy is always running discounts so wait a bit and keep watching and you'll be glad. I got this particular one for $1400, after $500 off and $100 student discount, which is a fantastic deal. At most, I would say this laptop is worth $1500-1550.\r\n\r\nSo about the laptop. The good things about this laptop include the usual perks of buying a mac. The forcetouch trackpad is excellent, the taller 16:10 aspect ratio is better for most things, and the overall build quality is top notch. I've been a windows user all my life, and I do think the mac is definitely built the best. Another convenience is having 4 usb-c ports and being able to charge with any of them. \r\n\r\nLastly, the battery life is about 7-10 hrs, depending on what you're doing. I get around 8, and I run Chrome and spotify for the most of it. It charges up pretty quickly though, and the included charger can also charger your phone if it is usb-c. \r\n\r\nThe laptop does have a few issues, however. The biggest I think is heat dissipation. It gets kinda hot near the touchbar area if you're doing anything somewhat intensive. The keyboard doesn't get hot, but it still makes me worry. Second, the touchbar really is just a gimmick. It actually gives some things more steps, such as changing your key backlighting. Lastly, a big issue many people have with this is the keyboard. Apparently it is an issue where dust will get under they keys and cause them to stop working. Apple now has a program however to repair your keyboard for free if that happens, so not to worry. The keyboard does have very low travel, but I haven't found it too much of a bother. The only problem is sometimes it's harder to feel out which key is which. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a great laptop. If you're on the market, I highly recommend the 2018 models over the 2017 or 2019. Intel upgraded their processors from dual core to quad core in 2018, so even though the 2017 models may be $100-200 cheaper, you're getting nearly twice the performance with the 2018s, which is definitely worth. You're also getting 4 ports instead of two, and the T2 security chip. As for the 2019 models, they just came out, and the performance boost is not at all that significant compared to the 2018s. So in that case, saving the $100-200 is definitely worth it. I hope this was helpful!"", 'I\'ve been using Macs since the 80s, and am not interested in using Windows, so this is not a review of Mac v. Windows. It is a review of how this particular Mac laptop squares with other options on the Mac side of things. My previous laptop was a 2014 15"" MacBook Pro. It was the maxed out version of that laptop when I bought it. It was super fast, and it ran very hot, and had issues (I think because it was so fast and ran so hot). Anyway, it died this week (my fault, spilled a little bit of tea into my laptop bag, and toasted it).\r\nThis laptop is a downgrade. Less RAM, slower processor, smaller screen, fewer ports. It is also about half what I would have had to pay for to get a MacBook Pro with similar specs to the one I am replacing. \r\n\r\nFirst, this laptop runs much less hot. I am typing this while downloading roughly 50GB of sound samples to install on the external SSD attached to it. It also seems to have multitasking down to a much more seamless process than my old MacBook. I am not missing a beat typing this while having multiple very large CPU intensive processes running in other programs. So, while it can\'t do the video or photo editing that my old MacBook could do (that had a dedicated graphics processor), I don\'t think I will miss it much, and didn\'t do that much creative graphics editing on my laptop anyway. For everything else, in real world use, this laptop is definitely snappier. I don\'t think it is just the newer generation CPU. I am guessing it is better integration of the OS with the laptop bits and pieces as a whole. The gestalt is just much improved.\r\n\r\nI was very nervous about the change in ports, knowing I would need dongles and docks and adapters. This has turned out to be true but less of a hassle or cost than I thought it would be. s I hope to have solved this issue by getting a couple of cheapo USB-C to Thunderbolt 3 adapters online, and then getting a new external monitor (Samsung SH850) which has a USB-C input port that then basically converts the monitor to a hub (it has a USB 3 port, a DisplayPort input) a headphone jack, and it even powers the MacBook Pro through the USB-C connection.

5998503 ,"('I already own a 15"" MacBook Pro and needed something smaller to use while on the road. I originally purchased a Surface Laptop 2 and even tried a Surface Pro 6 and ended up taking them both back due to a variety of glitches. \r\n\r\nI heard that they were using a quad-core processor so I decided to give the 13"" MacBook Pro a chance, and for the first time in a while, only got 8GB of Ram. I have to say that I was stunned at the speed and performance; opening programs like Lightroom and Photoshop were a breeze, and the movements and clicks were smooth as silk. I routinely use multiple programs at once and it rarely stutters. On top of that, the size is small enough to fit into a small bag and it\'s design remains one of the most beautiful on the market.', 'This laptop does not have ports for camera or phone. You have to buy an extra external port. This laptop is good if you like Apple. If you can afford the bigger one, I would go a step bigger.', 'This computer are very good and world very well I recomiendo', ""This is a fantastic laptop, if you can get a good deal on it. Bestbuy is always running discounts so wait a bit and keep watching and you'll be glad. I got this particular one for $1400, after $500 off and $100 student discount, which is a fantastic deal. At most, I would say this laptop is worth $1500-1550.\r\n\r\nSo about the laptop. The good things about this laptop include the usual perks of buying a mac. The forcetouch trackpad is excellent, the taller 16:10 aspect ratio is better for most things, and the overall build quality is top notch. I've been a windows user all my life, and I do think the mac is definitely built the best. Another convenience is having 4 usb-c ports and being able to charge with any of them. \r\n\r\nLastly, the battery life is about 7-10 hrs, depending on what you're doing. I get around 8, and I run Chrome and spotify for the most of it. It charges up pretty quickly though, and the included charger can also charger your phone if it is usb-c. \r\n\r\nThe laptop does have a few issues, however. The biggest I think is heat dissipation. It gets kinda hot near the touchbar area if you're doing anything somewhat intensive. The keyboard doesn't get hot, but it still makes me worry. Second, the touchbar really is just a gimmick. It actually gives some things more steps, such as changing your key backlighting. Lastly, a big issue many people have with this is the keyboard. Apparently it is an issue where dust will get under they keys and cause them to stop working. Apple now has a program however to repair your keyboard for free if that happens, so not to worry. The keyboard does have very low travel, but I haven't found it too much of a bother. The only problem is sometimes it's harder to feel out which key is which. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a great laptop. If you're on the market, I highly recommend the 2018 models over the 2017 or 2019. Intel upgraded their processors from dual core to quad core in 2018, so even though the 2017 models may be $100-200 cheaper, you're getting nearly twice the performance with the 2018s, which is definitely worth. You're also getting 4 ports instead of two, and the T2 security chip. As for the 2019 models, they just came out, and the performance boost is not at all that significant compared to the 2018s. So in that case, saving the $100-200 is definitely worth it. I hope this was helpful!"", 'I\'ve been using Macs since the 80s, and am not interested in using Windows, so this is not a review of Mac v. Windows. It is a review of how this particular Mac laptop squares with other options on the Mac side of things. My previous laptop was a 2014 15"" MacBook Pro. It was the maxed out version of that laptop when I bought it. It was super fast, and it ran very hot, and had issues (I think because it was so fast and ran so hot). Anyway, it died this week (my fault, spilled a little bit of tea into my laptop bag, and toasted it).\r\nThis laptop is a downgrade. Less RAM, slower processor, smaller screen, fewer ports. It is also about half what I would have had to pay for to get a MacBook Pro with similar specs to the one I am replacing. \r\n\r\nFirst, this laptop runs much less hot. I am typing this while downloading roughly 50GB of sound samples to install on the external SSD attached to it. It also seems to have multitasking down to a much more seamless process than my old MacBook. I am not missing a beat typing this while having multiple very large CPU intensive processes running in other programs. So, while it can\'t do the video or photo editing that my old MacBook could do (that had a dedicated graphics processor), I don\'t think I will miss it much, and didn\'t do that much creative graphics editing on my laptop anyway. For everything else, in real world use, this laptop is definitely snappier. I don\'t think it is just the newer generation CPU. I am guessing it is better integration of the OS with the laptop bits and pieces as a whole. The gestalt is just much improved.\r\n\r\nI was very nervous about the change in ports, knowing I would need dongles and docks and adapters. This has turned out to be true but less of a hassle or cost than I thought it would be. s I hope to have solved this issue by getting a couple of cheapo USB-C to Thunderbolt 3 adapters online, and then getting a new external monitor (Samsung SH850) which has a USB-C input port that then basically converts the monitor to a hub (it has a USB 3 port, a DisplayPort input) a headphone jack, and it even powers the MacBook Pro through the USB-C connection. Sweet.\r\n\r\nLastly, the screen is so much improved over my last laptop and This is light, solid, and so far, seems to be about perfect for my needs.', 'Was fortunate that I was able to return my 2017 i5 8GB 512GB 13 MacBook Pro on Thursday 7/12. Was exactly the 45th day I had to return it when Apple announced the 2018 quad core MacBook Pro\'s. Quickly returned my 2017. Saturday I went back and forth between the 2018 MacBook Pro 13 and Surface Book 2 13.5. Low and behold after further researching my local Best Buy actually had the 2018 13"" i5 8GB 512GB in stock. I quickly placed an online order and went to the store to pick it up.\r\n\r\nI can say that after using it extensively since Saturday evening, it is a major improvement over the 2017 models. Much snappier, battery life has been great, the new keyboard is a lot nicer, and the True Tone display is a welcomed addition. The SSD in this screams! \r\n\r\nGlad Apple finally got the 8th Gen chips out.

I previously ""donated"" my 2013 13"" MacBook Pro to my wife and that laptop has performed admirably. So, it seemed like it\'s replacement would be a good choice.\r\n\r\nI really like the performance of the laptop with the new 8th gen processor. However, I am not thrilled with the ""butterfly"" keyboard. It is definitely better than the original version but still not as responsive as the ""old"" Mac keyboards. I am probably one of the few people who actually appreciate the lack of ""traditional"" ports. I do not see this as a problem since external port replicators are readily available and relatively inexpensive. The one I purchased plugs directly into the two ports on the left side of the computer.\r\n\r\nI have yet to get used to the touch bar that replaces the function keys. As far as I am concerned, it is a gimmick with limited value. I\'d much rather see a touch screen than this ""Mickey Mouse"" feature.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the keyboard and touch bar I would have rated this a solid 5 stars....despite its cost.

I owned an HP laptop for more than 7 years, so I needed to upgrade. After researching and looking through many different brands / models, I chose the surface book based on previous reviews I read and because I am familiar using Microsoft products. \n\nI will start off with the negatives before getting into the positives. \n-My first complain is that at this price point, you still have to buy separate attachments if you want to do more with this product. Many laptops come with the pen, but you have to buy one separately for this one, which is like $100. I also had to buy a USB-c to hdmi adapter in order to connect my laptop to my projector.\n-Speaking of USB-c, I wish you were be able to charge this laptop using an android charger, given that it fits in that port. That way I wouldn't have to carry the bulky laptop charger around with me. Even if it didn't charge as fast as the laptop charger, it would still be nice to get some charge on the go in case of an emergency.\n-Given that I have an Xbox, I am familiar with the Microsoft store, so I knew what to expect in terms of the apps it has and doesn't have. However, it still bothers me that many apps are not included in the Microsoft Store compared to Google Play and the App Store. The apps that are available sometimes don't work either. It's not a huge deal breaker though because I can just use apps on my phone or the internet on the laptop.\nOverall, it seems like Microsoft expected you to spend money beyond just buying the laptop itself. From a business perspective, I understand what they're trying to do, and I know most companies do the same. From a consumer's perspective, I don't like it.\n\nThe positives definitely outweigh the negatives. \n-First, this laptop turns on very fast, within seconds, which is good because we expect technology to be quick nowadays. This would be a great laptop for those people that are impatient because everything runs quickly and smoothly. I have many windows open with many tabs, and I can still search for something or watch videos with no lag whatsoever.\n-Perhaps my most favorite thing about this laptop is that it is so versatile! You can pretty much move the screen all around (360 degrees). You can turn the typical 180 degrees, like any ordinary laptop. You can also detach the screen, flip it over and attach it again, and turn it however you want. You can detach the screen and use it as a tablet.\n-Speaking of tablet, this laptop has two batteries, which is not heard of often. Apart from the usual battery that a laptop has on the base, the screen itself (when you detach and use in tablet mode), has its own battery. This is awesome because your laptop actually lasts a long time before the next charge. I love not having to constantly charge it, or worry about having to charge it when I'm out of the house. \n-It is also awesome when you detach the screen to use it as a tablet because all you do is press a button and it automatically clicks for you to be ready to detach the screen. I don't have to worry about the screen accidentally falling/breaking off from the keyboard, unlike other laptops I have seen. The hinges that connect the screen to the keyboard seem very durable and unique, which I like. \n-An extra bonus is that you can actually play Xbox games on this if you own an Xbox. So that is a great option to have if you're on the road and don't want to bring your bulky Xbox with you. \n-The screen resolution is awesome and it feels really smooth typing on the keyboard. \n-Although I haven't extensively used it or stored much, it has a lot of power. You can casually use it for streaming and general searching, you can game on it using apps or Xbox games, and you can even create using large programs such as photoshop and other music programs.\n-It has a front and a rear camera, which is awesome because not all laptops have that feature. It is especially useful if you're using apps that require a rear camera or if you just want to take pictures - adding to the versatility of this device.\n\nOverall, this is an awesome laptop / tablet. There are some little things that bothered me a bit, but the laptop is 5-star worthy. There are many more positives that I can put on here, but this review is already starting to look like a book. I have yet to explore the full potential of the laptop, and that is what excites me about it because it is already a cool device."", ""I've wanted the Surface Pro for AGES.

Everything integrates nicely, keeping my huge files on an external (something I began with my last laptop) means that the smaller hard drive isn't an issue at all, and I've not had anything hiccough at all.

As a capper to all this, I find myself in two school programs, one for a BS in Business Administration and another for a certificate  in theology. I have worked in IT, mostly desktop support for small businesses, for over 20 years and am pretty familiar with SOHO-type business needs and usually buy my gear accordingly. I have been using a 17.5"" laptop for a few years now and have been very happy with it, but it is not terribly portable and takes up a lot of room on cramped desks and tables.  I am also something of a ""Horsepower snob"" and hate waiting for a device.  As a result, I was rather skeptical of the Surface products due to screen size on the Pro\'s and processor/RAM combinations in an affordable price range in the laptops.  Let\'s just say that I have been pleasantly surprised at my Surface Laptop 13.5.\n\nThe screen size is in fact adequate for writing papers and the keyboard is well laid out. The i5 quad-core is adequate to the task of Office apps (Word etc.) and while I wouldn\'t want to have to massage a large database on it, it will handle day-to-day needs quite well.  I also use a beast of a program called Logos for theological studies that indexes thousands of resources. While it does slow a tad when indexing it is entirely acceptable and once the indexing completes, work is seamless. \n\nThe screen resolution is razor sharp and highly readable, adding a USB external monitor gives me all the screen real estate I need for bigger projects and the combined package is easily portable.  Even without the external monitor I can easily research and write papers, I was pleasantly surprised at how workable the screen size is, even after using a 17+"" screen for years. I don\'t use the touchscreen feature much, being the ""Old-school"" guy that I am, but it does work and is accurate.  Battery life is outstanding, I can work all day and not worry about being tied to a power outlet. \n\nThe quad-core, dual-threaded i5 is sufficiently adequate for processing needs and Windows 10 plays nicely in 8 GB of RAM.  While the 16 GB model would be nice (More is always better right?) the cost differential is a bit much for me to justify as a student and as I mentioned, 8GB is sufficient.  The 256 GB of storage is adequate for the OS as well as a full installation of Office. two accounts for OneDrive with hundreds of documents each, Kindle with a couple hundred books, Logos 8 Silver with about 600 books and Google Drive with plenty of room left over.\n\nThe Alcantara keyboard is pleasant to type on and the touchpad is sufficiently sensitive without being obnoxiously sensitive. I don\'t even know if this has a fan in it, it stays cool under load and is dead quiet, so I never cared to check. The finish is high quality and looks great, although it can show a fingerprint or two now and again; nothing a quick wipe with a microfiber cloth can\'t take care of.\n\nWhile it does come with the standard games etc. from Microsoft, there is not a lot of bloatware and the games and so forth can be easily dealt with via a right click and ""Uninstall"". My only quibble is that I wish it came with Windows 10 Pro, but that is easily addressed with a quick trip to the Microsoft App Store.\n\nI would not hesitate to recommend a Surface Laptop 3 13.5 to any student or the vast majority of business users.

Once she got to Best Buy she realized how great this computer can be. She lives the touch screen as well. It may have been the one aspect that out her over the edge on this one. I have a touch screen for my work computer and have shown her how easily they can be manipulated to speed up multiple actions. She has taken to the computer and loves how light it is as well.

It does take a bit of getting used to having a taller screen though. I've only ever had the widescreen versions of laptops before. I've really come to like having the taller screen.

I didn't want the typical portable Bluetooth all in one speaker box. I also looked at modern day Boom Box's, and they were just wrong and I didn't want disco lights either. So I looked until I found this small LG Speaker bar and Subwoofer, The size was perfect for a new dedicated shelve. I didn't really get to check it out in store because they had it locked from Bluetooth connectivity. I went ahead and purchased it and took it home. RESULTS- Stupid easy to connect Bluetooth. NOTE- each speaker is Bluetooth and requires a dedicated power cord outlet. The Primary (left) speaker has an display to show functions like volume, sound modes, sub, treble, bass etc.., controlled by a wireless remote that allows me to skip a song while using Pandora from my phone (or use the phone for same) By this system having SEPERATE L/R speakers I am able to put some space between them. I found that by laying them down, it gave me the stereo separation I was wanting.\nAll that said, I am really impressed with the overall sound. The L/R speakers have good crisp/clean mids and highs, and do not sound compressed. The SUB fills the garage with the bass I was wanting. It wont make your ears bleed or feel the bass pounding in your chest. It just sounds good! But it is plenty loud enough to hear in the driveway.

Its innovative 2-in-1 design makes it truly stand out from the rest of the field. \n\nWhat I like:\n\n\n-The PixelSense display is absolutely stunning\n\n-Windows 10 really is the best Windows yet\n\n-Powerhouse performance thanks to a strong CPU, ample memory, and a discrete NVIDIA graphics. The Surface Book 2 will not disappoint in terms of handling pretty much anything you throw at it\n\n-Touch and pen input are a true joy to use\n\n-One of the nicest keyboards I have every typed on - great travel and responsiveness (although the backlighting could be better - see below)\n\n-Multiple configurations allow you to build a surface book that best meets your needs. \n\n-Surface Dock expands ports - I highly recommend purchasing the surface dock with this device. I wish there were more ports included on the device itself (see below) but the reasonably priced dock accessory somewhat makes up for it. \n\n\nWhat Could Be Better:\n\n-It's a shame that recently Microsoft has released two updates that caused issues and what is presumable its flagship device. The first update (May Update) caused the discrete graphics card to randomly disappear. The discrete graphics card was a major selling point for me, so this would be present an issue. Microsoft has since pulled the update while they work on a fix but it feels like releasing an update that you haven't fully vetted on a device that you manufacture is pretty sloppy and, honestly, a bit embarrassing. The second update appears to be more limited but some users have reported sever CPU throttling issues. Again, this shouldn't happen on a piece of hardware that carries the Microsoft name - if Microsoft has access to any devices to test its updates, one would think the Surface Book 2 would certainly be one of them! \n\n-I wish the track pad was slightly larger. It is an adequate size but, on the 15 inch model, there is plenty of real estate to make it even larger. \n\n-The device does tend to get pretty warm with moderate use - granted, there's a lot of power in this thing so it is not entirely unexpected. \n\n-Expensive. There's no question about it, you are paying a premium for a premium device. I was able to snag this on sale, which is the only way I would purchase it. \n\n-Limited ports - no explanation needed; there's just too few of them for a device at this price point\n\n-Pen sold separately: Again, at this price point, it would be nice not to have to shell out an additional $100 for the pen\n\n-Keyboard Backlighting: Lots of light bleed from the keyboard backlighting. This is a trivial issue but it does make the device feel cheaper/lower quality than it actually is\n\nOverall, I am very happy with the Surface Book 2. The issues I have highlighted are more than made up for by the positive aspects of this device. Microsoft has an excellent product here but, a few minor issues keep it short of perfection."", ""A lil difficult to open from the closed position, and dont like how the plug cover the USB-c port in the down wire position.

The i7 8th gen cpu is blazing fast and renders my 3d programs very quickly. The surface book 2 has a detachable screen and so it is great for taking notes and jotting down ideas. In class I use it a my one and only notebook using one note to create and organize all of my notes. Microsoft claims a 17 hour battery life.

I usually get 10+ hours with screen at 50% with a combination of office suite work, and with 3d anatomy open.\n\nGaming: When I want to relax and blow off some steam I run over watch and other newer titles on this. However, running video games at the book 2\'s native resolution is not ideal. The gtx 1050 in here is not great for near 4k gaming. \n\nVirtual Reality: I have recently gotten into vr in Microsoft\'s ""Mixed Reality"" platform. Playing many games from the Microsoft store and Steam vr store. Games such as: Super Hot, Space Pirates, DOOM VFR, and other vr titles run great on this. Unfortunately I do not think that the surface team originally had the book 2 in mind for MR. You have to use a usb c to hdmi adapter to connect the headset, and make an awkward stretch of the usb cable that is also needed to run the headset on the other side of the laptop. While in the vr experience I notice at times strange pulsating effects on the screen (not seen on my gtx 1070 gaming rig). It is mostly during loading screens though.As this version of the book 2 has only 256 of storage I use my external ssd to run this, and so I would recommend some kind of external storage if you plan on doing something similar. \n\nSALE: When I added my laptop to my cart I noticed that a MR vr headset was included in the purchase!

It's a very expensive laptop but I think it's overpriced and it doesn't meet my needs.\n\nAnother reason that is inconvenient is that you have to close photoshop if you want to detach the screen to change for a more comfortable drawing position.

Overall better than Surface Pro and any Mac for an illustrator.', 'If you\'re like me, here is the TL:DR in case you\'re like me and want to get to the meat and potatoes first:\n\nNo kickstand, moderately okay graphics card, digitizer technology that comes second only to Wacom, the fact that the silver on white keyboard backlighting is for some reason unsurprisingly hard to see in well lit areas, and the fact the Surface Book is essentually just a beefier Surface Pro, I sometimes question why I even considered it in the first place.\n\nNo I do not recommend the book line of products to pretty much anyone. You can find more value from other members of the surface family, and if you really need the horsepower, other systems like the Dell XPS 15 are boasting higher specs at a fraction of the cost.\n\nIf you\'re a graphics illustrator like me, this device is an absolute disappointment. I\'ve only had the device for less than a month and I have almost no incentives to stop using my dying Surface Pro 4 with a broken kickstand and dead pixel count that outnumber the boxes of cinnamon toast crunch my kids rip through in a standard month.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I LOVE the surface line of products and truly wish that microsoft afforded more money to the R&D team responsible for the Ntrig pen technology. I refuse to support the digitizer monopoly held by Wacom and ended up trading in my 27UHD Cintiq for my first surface pro 4. Bold claim, but I actually like my Surface Pro 4 better than any Wacom Bamboo, Intuos, or Cintiq product I have ever owned. I\'ve even tried those oddball Huion tablets and they don\'t even begin to compare.\n\nSo why then would I choose to go with the (still) heavily priced surface book 2?\n\nSimply, the prospect of a graphics card.\n\nBesides the fact that the windows 1903 update rendered it useless for a few weeks, I am genuinely not impressed by the performance. I understand I wasn\'t buying a full scale GTX chip, but I still find my surface gets bogged down quite easily when very little is actually using the GPU\'s processing power. I want to believe this is because in all my wisdom I bought a year+ old device, but I\'m not over here trying to stream the newest call of duty running 4k @ 2048 FPS on my twitch stream. Even with gigabit ethernet running through the USBC (also tested with A), letting the Nvidia GPU perform all the video encoding, I still get lockups and sometimes crashes when trying to livestream Clip Studio Paint or Photoshop.\n\nEven when the graphics card isn\'t having a panic attack, I find the experience I bought the device for simply lackluster as compared to other members of the surface family or competitor systems. In fact, whoever thought that not including a kickstand and instead force my neck to rely on this wobbly keyboard hinge needs to have their product design credentials revoked. I had to end up cutting down a piece of styrofoam to prevent my screen from moving when trying to do fine ink work. Sure I could flip the screen around and have it rest in ""studio mode"", but I prefer my neck not sounding like a bag of agitated pop-rocks when I need to design a conceptual piece for a client 6-10 hours a day. There are solutions around this, but the fact all the surface pro devices have a built in kickstand, there isn\'t a good enough reason in my eyes they couldn\'t offer the redundancy, or, release a performance base that works with the surface pros should you need the a graphics card attachment for whatever reason.\n\nIn my experience, the surface book is made for no one in particular and thereby fails to impress anyone. I have seen plenty of favorable reviews when using this device as a pretty rudimentary platform, but as soon as you get into more niche audiences, the jack of all trades façade really starts to show its cracks.\n\nIt is for all these reasons that I cannot justify a score higher than 2/5.

I preordered Surface Go on the BB site mainly because I was going to use the free $50 BB gift card with the purchase towards a Go keyboard. \r\nTo start off with I pretty much have all of the Surface family devices the studio, pro 4, and Book but I find myself using the Go the most because I move around a lot and all of the other devices are much too inconvenient. The Surface Book detached is actually lighter but the battery life for the tablet portion is not enough. \r\nI bought a Stream Deck Mini and have all of my macros programmed and this combo is a beast and fits my needs perfectly. The battery life is great too. I get about 7 hours but I can also charge through the USB C.\r\nI can’t review the 64gb version but my 128gb version with 8gb RAM fits my needs perfectly. \r\nThe premium keyboard came out to $80 with $50 off. I use a surface pen from my other device.\r\nOver all, this is my dream device. Small, powerful, and the keyboard doesn’t feel cramped.\r\nI don’t like Windows S (sorry Microsoft) but I was able to remove it using the free Microsoft removal on their Store. I feel that the device is crippled with Windows S, so make sure to remove it you plan to install other applications not found on their App Store.\r\n\r\nGreat job on the GO! I hope you keep innovating!', 'It gets so hot it feels as if it will catch on fire! Other than that it was great but a bit smaller then the surface 2', ""This is my first Surface purchase, and I must say that I am extremely pleased with this tablet. Bought it with a type cover and pen, plus an Office 365 subscription, which definitely will help if you get the model with less storage. The 8GB RAM with 128GB SSD model is more than sufficient for my needs. It even can go the extra mile with fuill virtualization support(Hyper-V), which I was very skeptical about before purchasing. Brought it home, turned of Windows S mode, upgraded Windows 10 home to pro, and this tablet is able to run any virtual machine(I've tried Android 8.1 x64, Ubuntu, a few others..) I have thrown at it. The SSD transfers data to and from the USB-C port super fast. I didn't know the Pentium series CPU was still being manufactured, nor would I have thought that it would be any sort of mobile performance contender, but the Intel®Pentium® Gold Processor 4415Y that this model is equipped with definitely surpassed my expectations(I usually stay working on a workstation with x2 Xeon CPUs with no fewer than 12 cores each, for a total of 48 cores, with HT of course). Great screen quality, decent resolution, touchscreen is super responsive. Excellent battery life. Decent camera quality.\r\n\r\nDEFINITELY recommend this tablet to anyone who is looking to try out a MS Surface product, or even looking for a laptop/tablet replacement."", ""To say I am impressed with the Surface Go is a complete understatement. Let me tell you why...\r\n\r\nI have been looking for a Windows PC to conduct my business on for a long time now. I use a desktop at my office and I purchased a Google Pixelbook (which is amazing by the way) with the hopes that I could convert my Microsoft office functions into gsuite. That didn't work out for me and my productivity away from work was not as high because of it. So I have been looking and looking for a laptop to travel with and plug into my monitor at home with at an affordable price and I couldn't find anything. So I waited until reviews of the Surface Go came out. I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase the high end model for $550 and boy was I glad that I did.\r\n\r\nI was afraid that I wouldn't be able to type on the keyboard (I have medium sized hands) and let me say the typing experience is immaculate. I type just as well on the smaller chick-let keys as I do a full sized keyboard. Another one of my fears was using an Intel Pentium Processor (which I haven't used since Intel created Core processors years ago) and I am floored at how good the processor is. I can run endless tabs, spreadsheets, etc and project onto my monitor with no delay. To put in terms of how good the Pentium processor is let me tell you... The Pentium Processor on the Go is 33% faster then the Surface Pro 3 Core I5 4th generation. Better yet, the Surface Go Pentium Processor is 20% faster then the SP3 Core I7 processor. It really goes to show how far Intel has come in just three years.\r\n\r\nThis computer is absolutely perfect for business as a travel companion or at home laptop (or docked with a monitor and keyboard). \r\n\r\nI am very impressed and I highly recommend this brilliant product by Microsoft."", 'I have been eyeing the Surface series of tablets for some time now. I have a largely Apple ecosystem and admit after switching to Apple after being a longtime Windows user a few years ago, I have some biases against Windows machines, though I admit the Surface series and their great reviews intrigued me. This experience has proven that MS has vastly improved and has produced an impressive series of devices with Apple-esque qualities in many ways.\r\n\r\nThis Surface Go competes against the iPads in many ways in terms of size, weight and portability, but has the added benefit of providing a full Windows PC experience, whereas the iPad cannot replicate that of a Mac to the same degree. Pairing the Surface Go with the Microsoft portable keyboard cover is a must if you want a tablet that can provide a full laptop experience. It\'s an extra hundred bucks as of this writing but is an absolutely stellar performer and worth the cost. I have a iPad Pro 10.5"" and can compare it in several areas for reference.\r\n\r\nThings I like about the Go (mine is the 128 GB/8GB RAM version):\r\n\r\n1. Small, portable and easy to carry. Thicker than an iPad but about the same weight, and the Microsoft keyboard you can (and should) buy separately is vastly superior to the iPad\'s, it includes an excellent trackpad, and fits the surface better and is flatter when folded - and provides a true laptop experience that an iPad cannot match.\r\n\r\n2. Very snappy performance. I almost got the more expensive & larger Surface Pro 6 because of performance concerns, but this Go with the Pentium processor has shown absolutely no deficiencies. Apps like Excel and Word, Edge, etc open quickly with no lag or delay.\r\n\r\n3. Gorgeous screen. I have read some people actually had an issue with 1800 x 1200 resolution, but seriously - remember, this is a 10"" screen and the clarity and sharpness are stunning, as good as any Retina screen. On full brightness it\'s beautiful, but I have to admit on half brightness, it\'s not as bright as an iPad on half brightness.\r\n\r\n4. Stand is integrated into the Surface Go\'s body. At first I was put off by this, but it\'s really a better design. It makes the Surface slightly thicker than an iPad, but the compatible keyboard is much larger and more functional than an iPad\'s since the iPad uses its keyboard as a stand, also.\r\n\r\n5. Micro-SD card slot in back behind the stand, so it\'s completely covered when the Surface is used as a tablet with the stand folded. Easy way to add cheap storage since Micro-SD cars are very cheap right now. You cannot add storage to any iPad.\r\n\r\n6. Touchscreen is extremely responsive and has just the right amount of sensitivity. Microsoft combines the traditional Windows interface with tiles so you can click them to open up apps.\r\n\r\n7. Flexibility - this thing functions well as a tablet, while you\'re laying in bed and surfing or watching a movie, and a full-bore laptop if you buy the keyboard designed for it, which I strongly recommend. The keyboard clasps to the Go magnetically and is powered by it. It\'s also backlit and has a full keyboard just like a standard laptop, and an outstanding integrated touchpad, which an iPad cannot offer. This means you can set this up on a desk and use it as a complete laptop, which makes using apps like Excel, Word and Powerpoint seamless and far less awkward than they are on an iPad. For a traveling tablet that can double as a work computer, this is a far better choice. \r\n\r\nThe iPad is superior in terms of OS ergonomics and snappiness, as well as battery life, as a tablet, but cannot double as a full-bore PC the way the Surface can.\r\n\r\nThings I am not crazy about:\r\n\r\n1. I bought a stylus with this, and pairing was difficult and took several tries. It appears to work but still does not show up as a device in Bluetooth devices.\r\n\r\n2. Battery life is mediocre at best. I charged this and my iPad to 100%, and the Surface dropped to 90% overnight with the screen off while the iPad dropped half as much to 95%. The iPad claims 10 hours of use and I cannot see this Surface getting more than 5 or 6 on a good day, with light use and a fairly dim screen. Maybe MS can release a firmware update to improve things, but this is definitely this device\'s Achilles heel.\r\n\r\n3. The Surface ships in S mode and works well in it. I am aware you can migrate the device out of S-mode into standard Windows mode. \r\n However, I am reluctant to shift it out of S-mode as it\'s a one-way move and makes the Surface less secure and worsens battery life, but S mode means you can only use Microsoft-approved apps from the app store, and those apps seem to be really limited. That means no Chrome, no iCloud access, no app for my bank, very few home automation apps, etc. that are all freely available in Apple\'s ""walled garden"" for its iPad. Apple allows OneDrive access while MS does not return the favor with iCloud. iTunes, fortunately, is available. Very disappointing and this removes a star from an otherwise excellent device.', '')"

6145602 ,"(""I'll try to make this review sweet and quick. If you want a laptop that can do a little bit of everything, this is the device for you. The SB2 (specifically the 15 inch version with the GTX 1060), is a laptop that is a jack of all trades type of computer, but a master of none (if that makes sense). The display is fantastic (however not the greatest compared to the OLED displays that many laptops are being shipped with now). The CPU is great for everyday use and even for some heavy processing work such as video/photo editing, music production, and gaming (however not the most powerful). \n\nThe design is beautiful, and the tablet functionality is awesome to have as well (although if you opt for this 15 inch version, the tablet isn't as practical in its use unless you're doing a drawing session or watching a media while laying in bed or something along those lines). And the battery life is STELLAR (given the display). I'd say you can expect (assuming you're just doing average productivity work), at least 8-9 solid hours, and probably closer to 10 if you put the battery into battery saving mode. Essentially, as long as you're not doing anything too intensive, you can expect to make it through a full day without needing to worry about finding the nearest power socket. The device itself is beautiful as well. Don't be surprised if you go into a local coffee shop and have people looking at your SB2 or even asking what your laptop is. \n\nLast thing I'll touch on is the gaming. Now, given that the 15 inch version comes with the GTX 1060 (which those unfamiliar is a mid-tier graphics card), you can expect to play any new AAA titles with no issues. For many demanding titles, you may not be able to play them at Ultra settings, but High and Medium settings will allow you to yield close to or even above 60 fps consistently. I would just recommend if you do plan on using this game, especially if you're planning to game for longer sessions (such as over 2 hours in one sitting) to undervolt the CPU. You can do this using ThrottleStop, but just make sure you do research before doing this as you could potentially damage the laptop. I personally have undervolted the CPU by around 100 mV, and so far it's been working great. This also lends itself to another advantage that this device has over your average gaming laptop. Because of the unique hinge design, the CPU and GPU are at separate parts of the computer, which allows the computer to not get as hot when gaming or doing intensive tasks that requires the GPU. \n\nTo sum this review up, if you want one device that can do it all, then the SB2 is the laptop just for you. It has an amazing design, unique tablet functionality, probably the most powerful GPU that you'll currently find in an ultrabook, and awesome battery life. The only con that I've come across is the price itself. I would recommend that if you are interested in purchasing this laptop to wait until a sale comes up. You'll at the very least be able to save around $300 for the laptop, so just wait a bit until you see a sale pop up."", 'This 2in1 is powerful, clear, easy to use and light weight.

The SSD makes retrieving my saved files faster than any harddrive I\'ve ever used, and the 2 USB-C ports on the side provide quick and easy access to either more storage or charging/connectivity ports for other mediums such as phones or standalone tablets.  Speaking of tablets, the Surface Book 2\'s ability to detach from the base and be used in Tablet mode is wonderful, and a 15-inch tablet with PixelSense visuals makes this comparable to ANY iPad Pro on the market. You are able to take the portable charger even if you don\'t take the base, and still be able to utilize your media. I personally have connected my Surface Book 2 to my Microsoft XBox One controller via Bluetooth to be able to game, and as this particular Surface Book 2 comes with 16GB RAM, it is capable of playing some of the newer games with great fidelity (I personally have tried ""DC Universe Online"", ""KurtzPel"" (FreeToPlay) and ""Destiny 2 ""FreeToPlay"", and the only snags I\'ve really run into is my own internet connection slowing me down (the Surface Book 2 kept up exceptionally well). I also plan to use it for video production for tutorials, but as yet have not tried out any video software on it. As the previous owner of a Surface 2017 model build, I had utilized the video card in that unit which was built with an HDD instead of SSD, and the only real difference between these 2 machines is the storage and screen resolution, so I\'m confident it will be able to run the video program I had previously been using. One major downfall is that they should have used a larger power supply. I sometimes see my power draining even while connected when utilizing the graphics card at high framerates and graphic fidelity (with screen at max brightness), but other than that, not very many issues. I\'ve owned this unit for 1 month, but when purchasing ANY electronic, I personally recommend getting the 2yr Best Buy Geek Squad Service Coverage . My previous Surface unit had Charger issues (would not charge the unit, with multiple batteries sent to my house and the store), so don\'t forget to add that to your purchase!', 'I purchased this machine two replace two - I was using an Alienware R17 for work/digital editing, and a Samsung Tab S3 with pen for artwork. While the Alienware was certainly up to any tasks I had for work, the Tab S3 was not keeping up with the demands of current digital art software. I do digital art as a hobby, and AutoDesk Sketchbook is my program of choice. I wanted a larger screen, more horsepower, and access to the full program on Windows (vs. the limited tool set on the tablet app). After a lot of research I bit the bullet and dropped the $3100 for a new Surface Book 2 (516GB SSD, 15""). I also purchased the Surface Pen and Surface Dial. The computer runs flawlessly and actually seems to be running faster after a month, perhaps it\'s gotten used to me! The machine is cool, quiet, and starts up in a flash. My Autodesk Sketchbook runs like butter, not jitter or delays - as close to drawing on paper as I\'ve ever had in an electronic device, but with all the power, flexibility, and convenience of digital vs. paper. The Microsoft Pen is infinitely better than either the Samsung pen or the Apple Pencil. The size and weight, combined with a very nice rubber nib, provide a nice silky glide with enough resistance so it doesn\'t feel like drawing on glass ala iPad Pro. The Surface Book gives me access to all of the program\'s powerful features and although I am not a professional illustrator, I would think even a pro would be able to make good use of this computer as a mobile tool. Haven\'t had much need for the Dial, I think I would have held off on that, but perhaps I will grow into it.\r\n\r\nOverall, it\'s a great machine. Wonderful display, great keyboard, plenty of power and speed in a super light machine. I use the detachable screen every time I draw. I just pop the screen and flip it around and reattach in display mode - the screen and base are still very light and thin. \r\n\r\nNo regrets on this purchase, I would recommend to anyone who needs a solid digital art platform but also needs horsepower for day to day computing needs like video editing, graphics editing, and MS Office programs. Do I wish it was cheaper - of course. But there just isn\'t anything on the market that compares to the Surface Book - giving you all the features of two or three devices in one compact, light, and efficient machine. I think that if you got a high end gaming machine + an artpad you\'d end up at the same price point, but with two devices. Throw in a high end 15"" tablet and you\'re now paying more than a Surface Book, so if you look at it as 3 devices in one (which it truly is) then it\'s a good value.', 'This is a very powerful laptop all squeezed into a sharp light package.  Very please with power and performance of this laptop.  With 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD will not be needing any other computer. Do have one minor issue that once you separate the keyboard you must make to reattach firmly otherwise the scroll pad will not work.', ""Longevity will be a concern as the first one had to be returned due to a faulty battery/wanky software issue that wouldn't allow the screen to detach and re-attach. The machine would just freeze. Multiple wipes and re-installations of the operating system didn't do any good. Bought another one and haven't had any issues yet. Wonderful screen. Great features. Blazingly fast boot-ups. Good feel and build quality (minus the original issue). Only had it a month yet have noticed other brands with similar spec'd models that are 1/2 the price.

I felt I couldn’t justify buying another laptop just to get slightly newer specs, so I opted for the Surface for the additional capabilities that can hopefully be used by the whole family. I love the surface pen and the ability to draw and take notes on the Surface Pro.  I find myself wanting to use it primarily as a laptop, so I miss the fact that the screen isn’t hinged to the keyboard, and I must have it on a flat surface like a table or lap desk in order to use it as a laptop. I love that it’s so thin that it easily slips into my zippered portfolio as shown in photo. I also appreciate that skins are so easily available, and I can customize and protect my investment.  Overall, it’s incredibly portable and versatile, and I’m looking forward to using it to its maximum potential.', ""Loving my Surface 6. I am replacing an older Dell Laptop, and this thing rocks.

Brought it home, turned of Windows S mode, upgraded Windows 10 home to pro, and this tablet is able to run any virtual machine(I've tried Android 8.1 x64, Ubuntu, a few others..) I have thrown at it. The SSD transfers data to and from the USB-C port super fast. I didn't know the Pentium series CPU was still being manufactured, nor would I have thought that it would be any sort of mobile performance contender, but the Intel®Pentium® Gold Processor 4415Y that this model is equipped with definitely surpassed my expectations(I usually stay working on a workstation with x2 Xeon CPUs with no fewer than 12 cores each, for a total of 48 cores, with HT of course). Great screen quality, decent resolution, touchscreen is super responsive. Excellent battery life. Decent camera quality.\r\n\r\nDEFINITELY recommend this tablet to anyone who is looking to try out a MS Surface product, or even looking for a laptop/tablet replacement."", ""To say I am impressed with the Surface Go is a complete understatement. Let me tell you why...\r\n\r\nI have been looking for a Windows PC to conduct my business on for a long time now. I use a desktop at my office and I purchased a Google Pixelbook (which is amazing by the way) with the hopes that I could convert my Microsoft office functions into gsuite. That didn't work out for me and my productivity away from work was not as high because of it. So I have been looking and looking for a laptop to travel with and plug into my monitor at home with at an affordable price and I couldn't find anything. So I waited until reviews of the Surface Go came out. I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase the high end model for $550 and boy was I glad that I did.\r\n\r\nI was afraid that I wouldn't be able to type on the keyboard (I have medium sized hands) and let me say the typing experience is immaculate. I type just as well on the smaller chick-let keys as I do a full sized keyboard. Another one of my fears was using an Intel Pentium Processor (which I haven't used since Intel created Core processors years ago) and I am floored at how good the processor is. I can run endless tabs, spreadsheets, etc and project onto my monitor with no delay. To put in terms of how good the Pentium processor is let me tell you... The Pentium Processor on the Go is 33% faster then the Surface Pro 3 Core I5 4th generation. Better yet, the Surface Go Pentium Processor is 20% faster then the SP3 Core I7 processor. It really goes to show how far Intel has come in just three years.\r\n\r\nThis computer is absolutely perfect for business as a travel companion or at home laptop (or docked with a monitor and keyboard). \r\n\r\nI am very impressed and I highly recommend this brilliant product by Microsoft."", 'I have been eyeing the Surface series of tablets for some time now. I have a largely Apple ecosystem and admit after switching to Apple after being a longtime Windows user a few years ago, I have some biases against Windows machines, though I admit the Surface series and their great reviews intrigued me. This experience has proven that MS has vastly improved and has produced an impressive series of devices with Apple-esque qualities in many ways.\r\n\r\nThis Surface Go competes against the iPads in many ways in terms of size, weight and portability, but has the added benefit of providing a full Windows PC experience, whereas the iPad cannot replicate that of a Mac to the same degree. Pairing the Surface Go with the Microsoft portable keyboard cover is a must if you want a tablet that can provide a full laptop experience. It\'s an extra hundred bucks as of this writing but is an absolutely stellar performer and worth the cost. I have a iPad Pro 10.5"" and can compare it in several areas for reference.\r\n\r\nThings I like about the Go (mine is the 128 GB/8GB RAM version):\r\n\r\n1. Small, portable and easy to carry. Thicker than an iPad but about the same weight, and the Microsoft keyboard you can (and should) buy separately is vastly superior to the iPad\'s, it includes an excellent trackpad, and fits the surface better and is flatter when folded - and provides a true laptop experience that an iPad cannot match.\r\n\r\n2. Very snappy performance. I almost got the more expensive & larger Surface Pro 6 because of performance concerns, but this Go with the Pentium processor has shown absolutely no deficiencies. Apps like Excel and Word, Edge, etc open quickly with no lag or delay.\r\n\r\n3. Gorgeous screen. I have read some people actually had an issue with 1800 x 1200 resolution, but seriously - remember, this is a 10"" screen and the clarity and sharpness are stunning, as good as any Retina screen. On full brightness it\'s beautiful, but I have to admit on half brightness, it\'s not as bright as an iPad on half brightness.\r\n\r\n4. Stand is integrated into the Surface Go\'s body. At first I was put off by this, but it\'s really a better design. It makes the Surface slightly thicker than an iPad, but the compatible keyboard is much larger and more functional than an iPad\'s since the iPad uses its keyboard as a stand, also.\r\n\r\n5. Micro-SD card slot in back behind the stand, so it\'s completely covered when the Surface is used as a tablet with the stand folded. Easy way to add cheap storage since Micro-SD cars are very cheap right now. You cannot add storage to any iPad.\r\n\r\n6. Touchscreen is extremely responsive and has just the right amount of sensitivity. Microsoft combines the traditional Windows interface with tiles so you can click them to open up apps.\r\n\r\n7. Flexibility - this thing functions well as a tablet, while you\'re laying in bed and surfing or watching a movie, and a full-bore laptop if you buy the keyboard designed for it, which I strongly recommend. The keyboard clasps to the Go magnetically and is powered by it. It\'s also backlit and has a full keyboard just like a standard laptop, and an outstanding integrated touchpad, which an iPad cannot offer. This means you can set this up on a desk and use it as a complete laptop, which makes using apps like Excel, Word and Powerpoint seamless and far less awkward than they are on an iPad. For a traveling tablet that can double as a work computer, this is a far better choice. \r\n\r\nThe iPad is superior in terms of OS ergonomics and snappiness, as well as battery life, as a tablet, but cannot double as a full-bore PC the way the Surface can.\r\n\r\nThings I am not crazy about:\r\n\r\n1. I bought a stylus with this, and pairing was difficult and took several tries. It appears to work but still does not show up as a device in Bluetooth devices.\r\n\r\n2. Battery life is mediocre at best. I charged this and my iPad to 100%, and the Surface dropped to 90% overnight with the screen off while the iPad dropped half as much to 95%. The iPad claims 10 hours of use and I cannot see this Surface getting more than 5 or 6 on a good day, with light use and a fairly dim screen. Maybe MS can release a firmware update to improve things, but this is definitely this device\'s Achilles heel.\r\n\r\n3. The Surface ships in S mode and works well in it. I am aware you can migrate the device out of S-mode into standard Windows mode. \r\n However, I am reluctant to shift it out of S-mode as it\'s a one-way move and makes the Surface less secure and worsens battery life, but S mode means you can only use Microsoft-approved apps from the app store, and those apps seem to be really limited. That means no Chrome, no iCloud access, no app for my bank, very few home automation apps, etc. that are all freely available in Apple\'s ""walled garden"" for its iPad. Apple allows OneDrive access while MS does not return the favor with iCloud. iTunes, fortunately, is available. Very disappointing and this removes a star from an otherwise excellent device.', '')"

The distinct alloy used for manufacturing the surface body, ensures that the laptop never gets heated up. The keyboard is sweet. It feels nice on your hands and performs as expected. \n\n2. Better Windows experience. Laptop manufacturer by Microsoft and better compatibility with Windows. While opening Microsoft applications you see it's smooth. I am heavy one note user and for me Surface fits my bill. Easy to work with multiple applications and it handled all of them easily.\n\n3. Battery and other performance. Battery lasts for solid 6 to 8 hours and I can leave for work without carrying my charger when the battery is about 60%. I haven't tested pushing the RAM out of its comfort zone,however as my profession demands me to run R, MatLab and Python at the same time and surface does a good job juggling these. \n\nSo surface is an all rounder and I am in love with it."", ""I work in and IT and fix and build computers for a living. This is the first Windows 10 device that I have seen that has inexplicable high memory usage. 8GB of RAM is enough to run nearly anything on Windows 10, yet the Surface Laptop 2 I purchased consistently sits at 90%+ memory usage without anything open or running. It's unbelievable really. I have spent the last 3 days trying to figure out what is using nearly all the memory on the computer and I have not been able to. It is extremely perplexing. I have even gone as far as wiping the hard drive and reinstalling Windows 10 from scratch and the issue persists. I ran a memory tests and they passed, so it's not faulty memory. I also used numerous RAM and memory analysis applications with no tangible results. I am now being forced to return this to get something else. I've never seen a computer eat up memory and then crash like this one, without any explanation. It seems the longer it sits, the more memory it uses. If I let it sit for a few hours, the memory usage goes up to 90%+ and never comes down until a reboot, but then the cycle starts all over again. I am hoping I most likely received a defective device, but I am not willing to take the risk and get another. I will have to find something else, which sucks, because the design of the Surface Laptop 2 is nice."", 'The surface pro 2 Laptop, is amazing. 13.3inch Touch screen.', 'I have spent a few days with this laptop and I must say that it is a gorgeous laptop. The surface laptop 2 is the perfect laptop for most people. It is a great device for everyday use to work in MS Office, check email, webs surfing and some moderate video or photo editing. \r\n\r\nI purchased this laptop for my work needs and it covers all areas that I need it for. I has the SP6 and while I loved that device, this was the better fit for me. I loved the experience that I had with the surface pro 6, it was fast, light, portable and versitile. However, when I removed it from my 27"" HP monitor, it showed its one real drawback. The screen size! The screen is gorgeous and amazing to look at, however, when using MS Office the lack of screen size makes everyday use a bit challenging. I needed something that was just a portable as the SP6 and offered the same gorgeous display in an elegant design. That is where the Surface Laptop 2 comes in. I love the 3:2 aspect ratio screen and the 13"" is perfect when wanting to work at a coffee shop on the couch. You just get so much more viewing area and that to me was enough to make the switch to the Surface Laptop 2. The performance is the same as the SP6 and I have experienced slightly better battery life with the SL2. \r\n\r\nThe alcantara keyboard is holding up well, although this is something that I am going to be very cautious about since I purchased the silver model. I just loved the color and design on this color SL2 over the black, blue and burgundy. Only time will tell how the alcantara will hold up and from my extensive reviews, it should hold up just fine. \r\n\r\nThe typing experience on the SL2 is just far better then what I was experiencing on the SP6. The keyboard is solid and has great key travel, it feels just well build and makes sending emails and using MS Office just a joy. I did like the SP6 type cover, although after using it for over two weeks, I just hated the hollow sound that keyboard made. I am always on the phone and my clients could hear me typing when I was taking notes. It is a small annoyance, but enough for me to consider the SL2 typing experience. \r\n\r\nThe speakers are also a huge plus on the SL2. They are LOUD!! Sound amazing and I find myself playing music on here more than on any other device I have (bluetooth speaker or iphone). \r\n\r\nSo far, I am incredibly happy with my purchase of the SL2 laptop. I am looking forward to using it extensively for work and personal use. Another reason why I went with the SL2 over the SP6 was that I was hearing rumors that the SP6 was going to get a major refresh in 2019. I could see that happening as the form factor of the surface pro has been mainly unchanged for a number of years now. The SP6 could use thinner bezels, updated ports and a slightly better typecover/typing experience. With that said, it was another reason for me to switch to the SL2 over the SP6. I will look to buy a new Surface Pro device once it is refreshed as I loved it that much, but for right now in 2018, the SL2 just made more sense for me. \r\n\r\nI can\'t wait to see what else Microsoft has up its sleeve in 2019.', ""I purchased this for work. I needed something light and portable. I was very happy with the specs for the price. I wanted something that was powerful enough that I wouldn't feel like I was sacrificing anything just to get an ultrabook. \r\n The screen is great, it's bright enough for my usage and I find the resolution just fine. The aspect ratio is great for productivity. I do enjoy typing on the keyboard. It's trackpad is good, nowhere near as good as a Macbook Pro; but that's a given. The backlight is excellent and the keys travel is much more satisfying than the newer Macbook Pro's. \r\nThe big reason for this purchase is the quad core processor. I don't need lots of power for daily use but it's nice to have. 128gb might be too small for some but for me it's just right. I do wish it had an SD card slot like the Surface Pro but I knew that before buying and could always store anything on an external drive.\r\nThe battery life is great. I get above 8-9 hours of usage out of it.\r\nI love Windows Hello. It's fast and nice to not have to type a password. This computer isn't well suited as a touch screen device. If that is important to you then the Surface Pro is a better option. I don't use the touchscreen and don't plan on using it anytime soon. It works and is functional but since this a traditional laptop, it's not ideal for using it as you would a tablet or phone.\r\n\r\nLastly this is not recommended for anyone wanting to game on it.\r\nIt's got an Intel graphics card and would probably only play the least graphic intensive games. You could probably play Fortnite at a very low resolution and with all the settings set to low and still only get 15-20fps. \r\n\r\nFor the price I paid $899 I am very happy. It's well made and has just the right amount of specs for my liking. I wanted a light and powerful laptop that I can take anywhere and not have to be tethered to an outlet. Plus the face that it's a Microsoft device and not a third party there is no bloatware. If you need Windows 10 Pro or really want to utilize the touch screen, I recommend the Surface Pro 6.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to computer hardware, and I'm been extremely impressed with this device. It has great fit-and-finish, the battery life is great, and does not get hot under load. My other primary reason for getting this laptop is because it doesn't have any bloatware from the manufacturer installed, unlike what you might see from a Dell, Lenovo or HP laptop.

I would like to see a couple of USB-C ports added. \r\n\r\nOverall I would say this device is great and I have never been a fan of anything ""Microsoft."" Good job with this one.', ""I can't believe how fast this Surface is and I'm glad I picked it out! Love using it!!"", ""Coming from an ancient Sony Vaio which was small and awesome for it's time, this was a very fun upgrade.  I love the tablet/pc feel as it is very easy to use either mode.  Touchpad great for me.  Not mac great but very usable.   The pen great when wanted but not required to do normal touch with fingers.  Thus you can leave pen packed up if you plan to do normal web surfing and typing.  On screen keyboard doesn't cover whole screen so  using it and scrolling page with finger natural when you just want tablet and are not in situation to set up the laptop on some table/stand.  Love the arc mouse but again not required since touchpad great.  I got the top of the line i7 with 16gb ram and bigger hard drive since I like to convert music, reencoding it and video.  Battery serves my normal daily amount, hours of heavy use.  Black is totally gorgeous.  I'm heeding warnings that it can scuff, so I got nice case for situations I will be packing it up and moving it with other items stacked in some backpack.   I hope it holds up over time but will update review if it doesn't."", ""I am an artist and a designer.  I use my surface everyday for drawing and designing.

Super satisfied with my purchase."", 'I am still learning this pc because I have only been using my iPad Pro for everything. What I don’t like about this type of computer is it is much harder to pay all my bills on this. The iPad Pro I can pay my bills in minutes. I can’t even do online banking with this new computer. I will have to see if I am doing something wrong. Maybe I did not even need this expensive pc at all. Oh Well.', 'There is absolutely nothing that can compare to the surface.  While on the pricey side, if you value everything that you do on your desktop and want everything on your desktop to travel w you at the same power and speeds, the surface is your #1 device.  Only con is the battery life is short.', ""I have been an apple user from the beginning, but when my iPad started to crap out again, I decided to cut the cord. I feel ipad/iPhone are great for kids but i needed something that would do more and donit better. I still wanted a tablet for streaming and game play, but i also wanted to photoshop and use office. I have had the surface pro 6 now about 3 weeks and some things have been a struggle, most of these things just being learning a different system. Just changing a setting can be a struggle at times. If you are getting this and you use windows or have an android phone this will be plug and use I'm sure without any issues. To anyone coming from iOS be patient and dont give up on this you wont be sorry. My only complaint at this time is almost petty, if you get the pen to go with this it will only magnetize to the left side. Of course if you're left handed this is great! However I'm not I wish it would stick to the right or even the top also."", '')"

Software used are mostly all Adobe, Ableton Live and Heavy coding with a lot of npm installation. Well, after thorough research, It came down to Speed, Compact, Comfort, Ease of Use in terms of what I was looking at. This new Laptop 2 check all of it including elegant and luxury design and buying this was the best decision ever made on a laptop purchase. The keyboard is so comfortable as to a level of taking my typing speed up a few notches, very clean and loudspeaker, sleek design, super slim, amazing screen and the touchscreen makes a huge difference when it comes to designing, navigating or using any kind of creative software, the craftsmanship on a laptop like never seen before and not to mention Matte Black is pure sexy! Yes, I bought Matte Black which I couldn't find on Amazon so leaving a review here as the specs are the same.\ufeff To anyone wondering, I installed Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Rush, Xd, Lightroom and used all of them. Did some run on regular use cases including designing, editing, saving and exporting and run blazingly fast in all of the apps. I still can't believe this is packed with this much speed in such a slim design just next level !! Highly Recommend!"", 'I purchased previously from best buy the ASUS Q536FD. Had to return 2 times; the first one had a buggy touchpad and the second one screen never came back on after initial setup. So I am in the store after my second return looking for something to exchange my ASUS with. For some reason the build quality of the surface laptop 2 catches my eye. I figure for the same price I spent on the ASUS which was faulty 2 times in a row, I might as well give Microsoft a chance. Decided to go with the i7 model. I thought that the 8GB of ram would be a big difference, but this computer is just as fast or maybe faster then the ASUS Q536FD. I am glad I decided to go with this model. Waking the computer from sleep is instant and hello face login is instant very fast and never fails (ASUS was slower with hello face, did not recognize me all the time, and slower when opening lid from sleep). For the price it would have been nice to see Microsoft give us 16GB of ram and a faster SSD or at least allow this device to be upgradable. If you are looking for an Ultrabook other than MacBook. This is the machine for you.', 'Performance and build quality are both top-notch. I’ve had it for nearly a month now...never thought about returning it within the 14-day window. Setup was easy, and the system quickly retrieved and installed all updates. I had consider a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, since my computer is the only tech item that I have that is not part of the Apple Ecosystem. After weeks of reading reviews and going back and forth between the Surface and MacBook, I’m happy I stayed with a computer that uses the Windows operating system...it’s what my family and I are used to. Windows 10 has been very stable for us. The Surface Laptop 2 is also more attractive when it comes to the cost compared to what you get with a MacBook. I got the black one to help hide wear and tear/staining of the alcantra keyboard area cover. So far, so good!', ""I work with automotive computers all day, every day. This means I am in and out of cars plugging into them and constantly using my laptop. I need good battery life,fast processing, a touch screen display for ease of use in tighter spaces, and the ability to close and open the computer many times throughout the day. This computer has covered all those bases and then some. It's built really well and is durable. After almost a year I haven't noticed ANY wear on the super smooth and soft alcantera keyboard area. I also have a 2018 MacBook Pro and I can honestly say this is a better computer for literally half the price. It just feels better and does everything so well. The speakers are great as well, easy to listen to videos in noisy areas. You won't regret this purchase! Great product!!"", 'I love the design, modern, cool and simple.

Only con is no of ports is too few', ""Overall this is one great laptop, and an excellent alternative to the MacBook Air or perfect computer for a previous Mac user. My rating is 4.5/5.\r\n\r\nMy Model - Surface Laptop 2, 8GB Ram, 256GB Storage, Core i5 (8th Generation), Matte Black.\r\n\r\nMy background is that I'm a previous Mac user. My last laptop was a 2013 MacBook Air and while I would have loved a new MacBook Air (2018), the keyboard reliability issues were a deal breaker for me, and luckily I'm skilled in both Windows and Mac. \r\n\r\nBuild Quality/Design - Excellent build quality, close to Apple's Macs, although the Macs do feel the slightest bit sturdier, but compared to an HP, Lenovo, Dell or any other windows laptop, this is at the top of the list. An option for metal instead of alcantara would've been nice, but take good care and be a little more careful (and don't get the silver model) and the alcantara should wear well. The look is really nice too, they definitely took inspiration from the MacBooks but instead added a more straight edged design theme overall, and the whole product looks and feels high quality. I really like the inclusion of multiple different colors. I chose the Matte Black due to it being on sale while others weren't, but the Burgundy also looks great, and I love how bright and vivid the Cobalt Blue is. While the Silver presents a more MacBook-like look, I would not go for that one, as the alcantara wears better over time in darker colors. The laptop has a good heft to it without feeling heavy, and is easily portable while offering great lap-ability (something the traditional Surface computers (which are really just tablets) can't really do).\r\n\r\nScreen - An excellent screen, at 13.5 inches the size is perfect for most, and colors look great, while the 3:2 aspect ratio is great for viewing documents and web-pages as there's more vertical space available. The screen can also be used as a touchscreen (if you're into that) but overall very good and comparable to most current laptops. Bezels aren't the smallest or the thickest, but overall good and a nice in-between.\r\n\r\nPorts/Charging - Here's the mixed bag for the laptop that most users/perspective buyers find fault with. One USB-A, a Mini-Display Port (Do people still use these anymore?) and a a headphone jack, that's it. While I don't use any USB-C devices or need a port for them, I can see how many would be upset by this as USB-C offers great versatility and power. The USB-A port is a nice convenience, especially when sharing documents with other computers/users, but the mini-display port should have definitely been a USB-C port instead to be more useful. I can't remember the last time I used a mini-display port to be honest and doubt many know what it really is. Charging is very similar to Apple's MagSafe 1 in which its magnetic. The charger does seem a little flimsy but the design is similar to Apple in which it will disconnect if stepped on adding a feeling of security. I do wish it were on the left side of the computer though, but that's just a personal preference.\r\n\r\nKeyboard/Trackpad - The keyboard is the one thing previous or current Mac owners will fall in love with. Unlike current Apple keyboards, the keys feel great and are full of excellent travel and feel, and good back-lighting. The keystroke is predictable and overall its super easy to type on this computer unlike the new Macs for some users. The trackpad is a typical Windows trackpad, in that its overall precise and the size is average, but Apple's current trackpads are still the benchmark in that they can be clicked anywhere and at any firmness of clicking while offering different levels of feedback. Gestures and scrolling do feel a little more awkward and less smooth than on a Mac, but that is mainly due to Windows and not the computer itself. The inclusion of an FN on/off key is genius as I tend to prefer to use the FN keys for buttons like volume, playback and brightness, etc. but when needing them for actual FN functions (like f1, f2, etc.) its really convenient.\r\n\r\nSoftware - Windows 10 is probably getting close to Windows 7 levels of perfection, at least in my opinion. When I got my MacBook Air, I remember that the disaster of Windows 8 had just been released, and that was one defining factor of why I went for the Mac. Thankfully the start screen is not an entire page but just a menu again, and navigating the file system has been easy for me. I haven't found much fault with Windows 10 other than the annoying automatic updates. Mac users likely will need more time to adjust to a new OS, but overall it isn't too difficult to use or adjust to.\r\n\r\nPrice - Like a MacBook the price of the Surface Laptop is high. Truthfully I would not recommend ever paying the full $1299 my model costs, but instead wait until a sale comes around and pick up the device much cheaper, like I did, paying $999, instead of the full retail price of $1299. Those deals while not too frequent, make the pricing easier to swallow, and make you feel better about yourself and your wallet.\r\n\r\nOverall this laptop is truly great, with its superb build quality and design, amazingly predictable and easy keyboard and other little touches, not only making it a great choice for many Window's users, but also any Mac users wanting/needing to switch and find something a little reminiscent of their MacBook."", 'I have spent a few days with this laptop and I must say that it is a gorgeous laptop. The surface laptop 2 is the perfect laptop for most people. It is a great device for everyday use to work in MS Office, check email, webs surfing and some moderate video or photo editing. \r\n\r\nI purchased this laptop for my work needs and it covers all areas that I need it for. I had the SP6 and while I loved that device, this was the better fit for me. I loved the experience that I had with the surface pro 6, it was fast, light, portable and versitile. However, when I removed it from my 27"" HP monitor, it showed its one real drawback. The screen size! The screen is gorgeous and amazing to look at, however, when using MS Office the lack of screen size makes everyday use a bit challenging. I needed something that was just a portable as the SP6 and offered the same gorgeous display in an elegant design. That is where the Surface Laptop 2 comes in. I love the 3:2 aspect ratio screen and the 13"" is perfect when wanting to work at a coffee shop on the couch. You just get so much more viewing area and that to me was enough to make the switch to the Surface Laptop 2. The performance is the same as the SP6 and I have experienced slightly better battery life with the SL2. \r\n\r\nThe alcantara keyboard is holding up well, although this is something that I am going to be very cautious about since I purchased the black model. I just loved the color and design on this color SL2 over the silver, blue and burgundy. Only time will tell how the alcantara will hold up and from my extensive reviews, it should hold up just fine. The black SL2 is just gorgeous and an amazing well crafted laptop. \r\n\r\nThe typing experience on the SL2 is just far better then what I was experiencing on the SP6. The keyboard is solid and has great key travel, it feels just well build and makes sending emails and using MS Office just a joy. I did like the SP6 type cover, although after using it for over two weeks, I just hated the hollow sound that keyboard made. I am always on the phone and my clients could hear me typing when I was taking notes. It is a small annoyance, but enough for me to consider the SL2 typing experience. \r\n\r\nThe speakers are also a huge plus on the SL2. They are LOUD!! Sound amazing and I find myself playing music on here more than on any other device I have (bluetooth speaker or iphone). \r\n\r\nSo far, I am incredibly happy with my purchase of the SL2 laptop. I am looking forward to using it extensively for work and personal use. Another reason why I went with the SL2 over the SP6 was that I was hearing rumors that the SP6 was going to get a major refresh in 2019. I could see that happening as the form factor of the surface pro has been mainly unchanged for a number of years now. The SP6 could use thinner bezels, updated ports and a slightly better typecover/typing experience. With that said, it was another reason for me to switch to the SL2 over the SP6. I will look to buy a new Surface Pro device once it is refreshed as I loved it that much, but for right now in 2018, the SL2 just made more sense for me. \r\n\r\nI can\'t wait to see what else Microsoft has up its sleeve in 2019.', ""This laptop is really light, really fast, and is great if you're a student or just want something portable and compact that still looks and feels great. Even while carrying in a Spek sleeve,(definitely recommend getting a sleeve or case for this laptop!) it still fits in my backpack with room for textbooks, notebooks and more with some space to spare.\n\nTyping experience is wonderful on this and the keys feel perfect, and are very quiet. The Alcantara makes for really comfortable typing and after a month, the Burgundy color shows no signs of palm marks or oil from my hands. \n\nThe aspect ratio is great for productivity, as I can comfortably fit nearly full textbook pages and word documents on the screen simultaneously.\n\nThe port selection is not a huge deal if you don't plug in lots of stuff. I only use USB A flash drives and head phones, so the lack of USB C hasn't affected me much. \n\nBattery life has been good so far. I can easily stretch the battery life over a few days, using it for about 2-4 hours per day.\n\nAesthetically, this computer looks great and the Burgundy color is beautiful. The shiny Microsoft logo is pretty appealing and have received compliments on the look of this computer. \n\nThe touch screen works great, and supports the Surface Pen. While it isn't the same experience to write with as the Surface Pro, you can still make it work and works well to highlight sentences in textbooks etc and take brief notes.\n\nI purchased this computer online and had it shipped to the store, and noticed that it had a small black scrape on the back hinge(straight out of the box) which is noticeable when the laptop is closed. The box was quite damaged and had a hole in it. It was sold out by the time I could actually exchange the product (when I picked it up) and I didn't want to settle for a different color, so I decided to keep it. \n\nOverall, this is a great product with excellent build quality. It's a head turner for sure and works like a charm. Snappy, beautiful body and display, and wonderfully portable."", '')"

6333551 ,"('This is my first Chromebook and based on other reviews I need to say: please, make sure you understand what a Chromebook is before getting one with unrealistic expectations. It will not run Windows programs, major video games, etc. \nWith that out of the way, I think this is a wonderful budget Chromebook. I wanted something with good battery life, enough RAM and processing for basic multi tasking, and a mid-size screen. IMO 11"" is too small (might as well use my 10"" tablet) and 15+"" is harder to travel with. My 14"" Chromebook is fitting perfectly in between my 10"" tablet and my 17"" gaming laptop. Perfect size to travel with but big enough to see while on your lap instead of holding it up to your face. \n\nWanting it mostly for multi-tab web browsing and doing financials/budgeting, I knew it was silly to get the $400+ models for my needs (although it was tempting). This handles multi-tab Chrome plus a couple other apps all at the same time very well. Every once in a while some slight slowness loading things but so minor it\'s nitpicky. \n\nThe keyboard is good for my needs but I\'m no professional writer so not great at reviewing keyboards.

I figured at this price I should definitely check it out. This is my first Chromebook, up until now I have been a Mac user at home and Windows user at work. Having used this computer for a bit now I can say I am definitely a fan of ChomeOS; it is very user friendly, simple, and elegant. Right off the bat the build quality of this computer is fantastic. It feels solid, has 2 standard USB ports, 2 USB-C ports (which is also how it charges) as well as a headphone jack, and micro-SD. The keyboard has a great feel to it and the 14 inch screen is a great compromise between size and portability (oh and by the way this thing is super light). From my experience this computer has been great for creating/editing documents and spreadsheets, surfing the web, checking email, and streaming Netflix/Hulu. As impressed as I am with this computer, there are two drawbacks that do ump out at me… The display quality leaves plenty to be desired. To me the display appears to be washed out and poor contrast, additionally, the keyboard is not back-lit. But in my opinion, the pros significantly out-weigh the cons. I would definitely recommend this computer to anyone with basic computer needs on a budget. Even at the full price of $249 this is still a great computer.', 'It perfectly serves the intended purpose.

6364574 ,"(""I'm a front end software developer. I purchased this for hobby projects, including some graphic design and photo work. My work machine is a newer MacBook Pro with touchbar, which cost my employer 5x what I spent on this HP.\n\nGood:\nKeyboard, ability to upgrade, good CPU and GPU, ports & card reader\n\nBad: \nScreen, sound\n\nSound:\n\nFor a cheap laptop, the sound is usable, but HP is using B&O as a selling point. The sound is hollow, though there is plenty of volume.\n\nScreen:\n\nThe screen is the biggest downside. The screen resolution is as good as you get at this price. The matte finish prevents glare. It is plenty bright; I've been running it at about 50% brightness. But, its not great. The colors seem off and it just looks like a cheap screen, maybe I'll be able to improve it by messing with the calibration settings. MacBooks have beautiful screens and this one is only better in that there is less glare.\n\nThe build quality is fine for the price. There is plenty of flex in the lid/monitor. The main body of the machine feels good with very little flex or soft spots. All the weight is in the body and there are nice rubber feet so the machine does not slip while using it.\n\nKeyboard & Trackpad:\n\nThe trackpad is usable. I don't like it, but it is not a big deal.\n\nThe keyboard is probably my favorite part. Way better than the MacBook. The keys have nice travel for a laptop. The green back-lighting has 3 settings, high, low, and off. I think the high setting is a bit obnoxious, but I really like the low setting. It is easy to see without being obnoxious like some RGB gamer lighting. My only keyboard negative is that the number pad, which I never use, pushes the main section off-center.\n\nSpeed:\n\nIts fast. Running a build in Node is a single threaded process and it is fast. The MBP is faster, but that is too be expected. I feel it should boot faster than it does with the m.2 drive, but I'm going to blame that on Windows. I think a cheap RAM upgrade would really make this a multitasking champ.\n\nExpandability:\n\nAll the ports: usb-a (the old one), usb-c, hdmi, ethernet, and a card reader. Can't charge over usb-c.\n\nOpen RAM slot. I could add another 8gb for around $30 or a 16gb stick for around $60. I will probably do the later for a total of 24gb of ram. Mostly for Chrome :P\n\nOpen 2.5 drive bay (There is a black plastic HP-imprinted space holder you can see in the pic). The drive in this is an M.2 stick and there is room to add another drive. I had an older HDD sitting around so I tried it. The spec on that drive says it is 0.37in thick. It was a bit too thick. I probably could have made it work, but most new SSDs and lower capacity HDDs are thinner.\n\nTo open it up for RAM and drive additions, turn it off and flip it over. There are 3 short screws on the front edge and 4 long screws near the back rubber foot. Start at a corner and pry it apart with a credit card. I had to start it with a very thin screw driver. Pry all around and the whole bottom will pop off.\n\nBattery:\n\nIts fine. Its telling me I have 10 hours left. With heavy use, especially if the better graphics card is engaged, the life will be more like 3 hours.\n\nBy default, the machine does not report estimated remaining battery time to Windows, just percentage. On boot, press [F10] to get into the bios settings and you can change there."", 'I am very excited just got this for gaming and surfing the web I will use this for casual gaming and my Xbox for hardcore gaming.', ""I'm not really a gamer. I purchased to dual boot with linux and use. I was able to install LInux Mint alongside Win10. Only thing that didn't work right away was the wireless. I was able to get the wireless to work, graphics improved too with Linux after upgrading the kernel to 5.2. \n\nRuns windows well. I don't use it much. Only to check for updates. The laptop itself is a quality build. I am very happy with my purchase so far."", ""Lets get straight to the point here, I'm a gamer and have been for about 40 years. I'm also a gamer on a budget and that's why I went for this HP laptop. The Gfx chip in this little wonder is not the best, It's not going to run VR, It's not going play the latest and greatest at fully maxed out settings. What it will do is play the latest and greatest on a budget. \n\nPros..\n\nReally nice keyboard. The button presses are smooth and very responsive and honestly can not feel any bending of the laptop when pressing the keys. The back light has 3 modes, off/on, medium and full. Its a nice green glow and makes the keys super easy to see when the room is dark. \nConstruction of the laptop is again super nice. It is plastic but it does feel quite sturdy. The laptop screen doesn't wobble when typing and the hinges feel very sturdy.  I\nUpgrading is easy! I placed a 8 gig ram upgrade in this before I even turned it on for the first time. ($30). I also added a 1 terabyte HDD, which again was easy to do. You can find the spare bay inside the laptop under a HP plastic insert.\nGaming is really nice on this laptop. I am a member of Microsoft's game pass as well as a Steam user and I've had everything from Witcher 3 to GTA running on this laptop at a nice steady 60 fos with most of the settings maxed out. \n\nCons..\n\nFinger print magnet! The front cover collects finger prints and in a matter of mins your nice shiny laptop will be covered in finger prints. No real biggie as a cloth takes them off.\nI've notice the laptop can get a little warm. I have mine running on a laptop cooler, even when I'm sitting with this on my lap I have the cooler running.\nThe internal HDD upgrade was easy enough but I honestly do not know why HP felt the need to place a plastic HP branded cover over the bay. It usually takes second to install a HDD but the process took me about 20 mins as I had to undo the fiddly screws holding the cover in place. Why HP?\n\nTo sum this all up, if like me you are a gamer on a budget and can only dream of winning the lottery then this machine is for you. It will play the latest and greatest but it wont play them maxed out. So you have to expect a little give and take while using this machine. Its slick, looks good, runs well and is really quiet even when the fans are going full blast. In my opinion its worth every penny! especially if you pick it up at the price I did .. $450! Thanksgiving sale. At this price its simply to good to say no. 5 well deserved stars."", ""This laptop was a solid buy for me. I'm very pleased with how smoothly it runs.

I only paid like 30 bucks for the other memory stick. I bought this on sale for $450 but I also had 35 bucks in BB rewards so I got it for $415.

6376412 ,"('This laptop truly is stunning, it screams sexy from the minute you open the box. The design aesthetic is really modern and the build quality is solid. Everything from the super thin bezels to the ""strange"" diamond cuts and the full metal body itself, give it a premium feel. The hinge feels like it will last a life time, it has almost no sway, and you can easily swivel it with one hand, without worrying about twisting one hinge more than the other.\r\nBut going with that shiny, metal theme, HP have put a glossy screen on this machine, and overall I was not that impressed with it. I much prefer a matte screen and it just felt like there was a bit of motion blur when watching sports on this. And a washed out feeling to it whenever brightness is increased. It is either the panel itself or the factory settings for the display.\r\n\r\nIO wise - it has 3 USB ports - a Thunderbolt port (acts as the charging port as well), another USB-C port and another USB-A (collapsible port). It has a 3.5mm headphone jack (thanks HP!), and a micro SD card reader. I guess asking for a collapsible Ethernet port and an HDMI port is too much to ask here, I\'ll survive.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is good, not IBM good, but good. The track pad seems smooth, and the clicks are clean. The inbuilt audio is actually pretty decent for a small form factor. And the webcam and mic both lend to a really good video calling experience.

It did handle all of my daily chores easily, thanks to the 10th Gen i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and the SSD. Don\'t be fooled by the base clock of 1.3GHZ, this processor can handle whatever you throw at it. And lends itself to a really good battery life.

Which takes us to the stylus that comes with it (it comes with its own AAAA battery). The stylus is good if not great, and you can use it up to take notes, or draw to your heart\'s content. There are a couple of magnets on the body which can hold the stylus, but I don\'t believe they were meant for this, because it is a really awkward hold, and not that strong.\r\nI have liked the touch screen responsiveness as well (and so has my 2 year old!).\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I think I have listed down more negatives that I thought I will when I sat down to write this review. But I believe that\'s just because I don\'t think any of the issues I have listed above is going to stop me from using this daily. For daily tasks I don\'t feel I am giving up anything from my other beast laptop with an integrated GPU and extra ram for that gaming power. This is a full on recommendation from me.\r\nIf I could take away half a star I would - because the screen is not to my taste, and the HP support site doesn\'t seem to be updated for this model yet. Hopefully, that\'s coming soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor stuff for the end - The power brick is pretty small (good!). If you get the HP cover for the laptop, it has a nice little pocket for your stylus, and is a really nice slug fit over your laptop, and is thick enough to provide decent protection from falls.\r\n\r\n(Oh, and the power button is hidden in that ""diamond cut"" side on the top left corner, you are welcome! Took me ages to turn this thing on!!)', 'The HP Spectre X360 is what a laptop should be. It looks great, it\'s fast, and the battery life is excellent!\r\n\r\nPackaging\r\nThe packaging is the first thing you notice. You open the outer box and inside you\'ll find an elegant, shrink-wrapped inner box (see picture). Open that and you\'ll find the laptop, a nice AC adapter, an Active Stylus, and a think leather-like case. The power cord that goes from the small brick on the AC adapter to the laptop is braided - which may seem small but it\'s still a sign of the quality of this laptop. You can see the AC adapter in one of the pictures. It\'s small with a short cord that goes to the wall and then the long, maybe 6 feet long, cable that goes to the laptop. Not only that but this laptop charges via USB C. It will charge fastest, but not too fast, with the included power adapter of course but you could probably use most USB C chargers, like for a smart phone, to charge it. They\'ll just take longer. I used one from another laptop that had a lower power charger with it and that worked fine, it just takes longer.\r\n\r\nDesign\r\nIt\'s looks great! When you open it you will notice the small bezel around the display and small amount of room around the spacious keyboard. Space is used well! It has funky top corners but they look cool. The one on the left has the power button and the one on the right has one of two USB C ports. I\'m a big fan of the 2-in-1 form factor for a Windows 10 laptop. There are lots of great apps that run on Windows 10 and are designed for touch input. they really need a 2-in-1 to use them well. I also like to fold it back with the keyboard down when I use it on the sofa to show photos or video to family or browse on my own. The case that it comes with looks great and offers some protection. I\'m also very happy it includes the Active Stylus. While there is no built in storage for it, a stylus can be very helpful for some apps and if you need it your finger really will not cut it. The Stylus takes one AAAA battery which is included. It also has Bang & Olufsen tuned audio. I haven\'t done much audio playback yet but they sound very good. Audio sounds rich for laptop speakers and the volume is good.\r\n\r\nPorts\r\nThe HP Spectre X360 13.3 has two USB C ports, One USB Type A, one MicroSD slot, one stereo audio jack (headphone jack). It also has a camera that works with Windows Hello and a fingerprint reader. In addition there\'s a physical switch on the right side of the laptop that lets you disable the camera instead of putting an ugly cover over it. The USB type A port, which is on the left side, actually closes part way when not in use. This lets the laptop keep a cleaner look making the cut of the angles around the laptop match on the sides. The mechanism works very well, so it\'s still easy to insert a USB cord with one hand. The USB Type A port is USB 3.1 Gen 1 and the two USB C ports are USB 3.1 Gen 2. Both USB C ports can be used for data or charging the laptop.\r\n\r\nWindows Hello\r\nThis is the first laptop I\'ve had that supports Windows Hello with both the camera and the fingerprint reader. Both work very well for me! In general use I use the camera most because it\'s the easiest and it basically works by accident. I need to move my face out of the way to use the fingerprint reader. Anyway, both recognize me fast. The fingerprint reader is very fast. The camera may take a second or two but seems basically instant to me. Sometimes it wants me to swipe up too but that seems to be when I lock it. When I reboot the laptop it seems to go right in when the camera sees my face. it\'s easy to tell when it\'s looking for you because besides seeing an eye animation on the screen there are two red LED lights that flash above the display.\r\n\r\nPerformance and Battery life\r\nThis laptop is fast and has great battery life! The version with 256GB of storage is rated for up to 22 hours of battery life! All I can say is I\'ve never needed to charge it more than once a day so far and I\'ve done a lot in a day that would normally take a lot of battery power, like installing all the needed Windows Updates. Not only did it do that without breaking a sweat it was probably on for at least four hours or more and still only down to 75% or so. I did turn the display brightness down for some of this but either way, taht\'s good. The Windows Updates installed very quickly, maybe an hour or two which was very fast for how many were installed and the fact that some were large ones. I\'m most surprised by how the battery lasted through that. Besides Windows Updates I\'ve installed a number of other applications like GIMP, Blender, and Audacity. Everything downloads quickly, installs run fast, and applications run fast! It\'s noticeably faster than my still fast but aging i7 laptop from 3.5 years ago. The 10th Gen i7 CPU is a 10nm processor which means it\'s pretty power efficient and doesn\'t generate a ton of heat. It also has 4 physical cores and 4 hyper-threaded cores for a total of 8 logical CPUs, which is very good for a laptop! The 32GB of Intel Optane Storage apparently makes the already fast 500GB (You actually have 476GB usable on drive C:) SSD faster.\r\n\r\nSoftware\r\nIt included a trial of McAfee, Office, and some other things you may or may not find helpful. I like HPs software to check for updates from HP. There were a few items to install when I got it.\r\n\r\nOne Change to Make\r\nOut of the box Windows will not show you the amount of time remaining for the battery. It will give you a % but that\'s all. Thankfully, it\'s not too hard to change. If you go into the BIOS on the laptop you can find the settings for the battery to report time left and then exit, saving your settings. Windows will then show the amount of time left. Sure, it will not be perfect but I find it much more helpful than the %. To get into the BIOS press the <ESC> button repeatedly when you first turn the laptop on. If you get it in time you\'ll get to an HP startup screen instead of Windows and from there you can choose to go into the BIOS, I think it\'s <F10>. You can find the setting in there to enable the time left in Windows.\r\n\r\nThe HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 13.3"" is one that I highly recommend. The size, performance, battery life, form factor, and included case and stylus make it a great package. Some people may need 16GB of RAM depending on what you\'re doing. If so, buy a model that has that! Otherwise 8GB of RAM and 512GB of Storage should be good for most people. You\'re getting a great package for your money with the HP Spectre X360 Windows 10 2-in-1.', 'In a previous review of an earlier model of the HP Spectre x360 13-aw0013dx (Model 13-aw0013dx), I noted that Hewlett-Packard\'s home computers were among the best available in the 1990s, very competitive with home computers from IBM and Apple. But somewhere along the line (maybe when they merged with Compaq) HP lost its glamour. Their desktops and laptops became very middle-of-the-road, functional machines, but nothing special. I always purchased another brand. But when I began using the HP Spectre x360 Model 13-aw0013dx in 2016, I fell in love with both the style and performance of this machine. Many times, I thought to myself, ""I will never have to get another laptop, this one is so great."" But you know how it goes. That was back in 2016, and this is 2019, so it was time to see how these Spectre x360 machines have improved.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe I was right back in 2016. The 2019 Spectre x360 has a number of small, incremental improvements over the 2016 model, but I am honestly not that excited about switching laptops yet, with all the hassle of reinstalling all of my applications, switching licenses, and so forth. Yes, it is nice beginning with any new, uncluttered computer, but it is not yet clear whether this factor plus the small improvements are enough for me to make the change yet. I believe I will continue using my older laptop for a while.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say that the newer Model 13-aw0013dx isn\'t a great laptop. If I have been feeling like I could use my 2016 laptop forever, and the 2019 model is a tiny bit better, then I can see myself using it for a long time, too. Both laptops are super light—my postage scale reads 2.75 pounds for both of them. Both have beautiful, sleek, silver bodies. Both have a pretty good display with 1920x1080 resolution, although the glossy screens on both sometimes reflect light in an annoying way. The backlit keyboard on each is handy in dim light. It took me awhile to realize that you need to shut this off in good light, however, with the F5 key or you will not be able to read the keys. Both switch to tablet mode if you flip the display 360° (which I suppose is why they call these x360 laptops), although I am not a big fan of the Windows 8 metro interface in tablet mode. I am happy enough being able to touch the screen occasionally in tablet mode.\r\n\r\nThe audio (Bang & Olufsen) on both is mediocre but acceptable. Although the audio system is the same on both, the sound seems a bit louder and brighter on maximum volume on the older model, I think because some of the sound leaks through the heat vent on the top surface of the laptop. The newer model\'s heat vent is in the hinge. The sound is actually designed to be projected out of the bottom of the laptop, so maybe I am just imagining the difference. Sadly, the camera on the newer model is not as good, with top quality at .9MP, 16:9, 1280x720. In contrast, the top quality of the camera on the older model is 2.1 MP, 16:9, 1920x1080. The difference is notable. Pictures on the older model are darker but not as fuzzy. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of heat vents, the 2019 model seems to run a bit hotter than the 2016 model. But if heat is a problem, you can make an adjustment in the settings to reduce power for a little less heat. I haven\'t felt the need to do this because I haven\'t blistered myself yet on the newer model.\r\n\r\nBoth laptops have powerful i7 processors and fast SSD drives for lightning-quick processing. I have 8 GB RAM on both although I understand that there might be versions with 16 GB. A flaw with both is that the amount of RAM is fixed so that you cannot upgrade yourself. Both have one USB-A and 2 USB-C Thunderbolt ports, one of which can function as the power supply input. I had some trouble connecting device to the Thunderbolt ports on my older machine, but that seems to have been cleared up on the 2019 model. I often had to plug my Samsung Galaxy into the USB-A port when the USB-C port didn\'t recognize it. At least in theory, the Thunderbolt port is faster than the USB-A port, and would be better for apps like Samsung DeX (which is incredibly cool with the Spectre, by the way.) So, the USB-C port needs to work reliably. This is really important if you want HDMI or Ethernet connections because you will need to plug dongles into the USB-C port. And because there are only two of these ports and one is likely to be dedicated to power, you might want to invest in a little Thunderbolt dock, which I eventually did.\r\n\r\n(That\'s the thing about these ultrabooks. You can end up getting all kinds of accessories like docks and portable DVD drives such that the total hardware mass is the same as a normal laptop. But at least you have a choice not to carry around all the accessories if you don\'t need them on a particular day.)\r\n\r\nSo, what are the improvements on the 2019 model of the HP Spectre x360 Convertible Model 13-aw0013dx? The footprint is ever-so-slightly smaller (see picture of my two Spectres side-by-side). However, it is a tiny bit thicker at the hinge, which makes it somehow feel clunkier than the older model even though, overall, the 2019 model is smaller.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I like about the 2019 model is HP\'s decision to cut off the corners at the top of the laptop base, placing one of the USB-C ports on the right-hand cut-off corner and the power button on the other cut-off corner. This doesn\'t matter when your power supply is coming from the right side of the computer, but makes plugging in the power supply cord less awkward when your power supply is coming from your left. And, after I finally found the location of the power button (I had to look at the one-page set of instructions to locate it), I am able to get to the power button much more easily than the tiny button that is on the left edge of the 2016 model.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 model has fingerprint recognition as well as face recognition for logging on, and the former is supposed to be more secure than the latter. The fingerprint recognition works for me about 80% of the time. But when it does not work it is unforgiving—if your print is not recognized after two tries you are forced to use your PIN.\r\n\r\nI think I like the newer power supply, which has a fabric rather than plastic cord, a little better, although there is no objective reason why. My earbuds with fabric cords do not tangle the way my earbuds with plastic cords used to, so maybe that\'s why I like the newer power supply, although I never noticed any tangling with the plastic cords on the old power supply. The 2019 power supply is 65W and outputs between 5V@3A up to 20V@3.25 amps, compared to the older power supply\'s 45W and outputs between 5V 3 A up to 20V@2.25amps.\r\n\r\nThe SSD of the 2019 model is double that of the 2016 model, 512 compared to 256 GB. I went the longest time without needing to worry about space on my older laptop, but recently I\'ve been warned about low disk space with only about 20 GB free.\r\n\r\nFinally, the 2019 model of the Spectre x360 comes with a light pen. I\'m not sure I\'ll ever use it in a serious way, although I tried it out in Paint and it works very nicely.\r\n\r\nSo, there you are. The 2019 model of the Spectre x360 is marginally better than the best laptop I have ever owned, one that feels like I could use forever. So, at some point I will make the transition to the newer model.', 'Small, powerful and well built 13.3"" convertible 2-in-1 laptop.\r\n\r\nHP is one of the best computer brand, I would say in the top 3 and in my experience, \r\nHP makes top quality laptop and is the brand I would go to first if I want top quality and affordability. You get best bang for your buck.\r\n\r\nThis new Spectre x360 2-in-1 2019 model is as expected well built and well designed.\r\n\r\nIt is smaller than the 2017 model I have with the same size screen and keyboard due to its super-slim screen bezel.\r\nComes with Intel’s 10th generation Ice Lake CPU (the latest CPU) and Iris Plus graphics which is as good as MX150.\r\n\r\nIt start up very fast and does everything quickly.\r\nI can play Fornite in medium setting where I had to set to low setting when using the 2017 model.\r\n\r\nEven with its smaller size, it has amazing battery life up to 22 hours for FHD screen. I used the laptop for 2 days on and off without recharging. \r\nI will definitely bring this on long plane trip.\r\n\r\nAlso it is not hot and not noisy thanks to the more efficient CPU and laptop design.\r\n\r\nThe power button is at angled corner on the left prevents unintentional pushes.\r\n\r\nThe touchpad is definitely improved over the 2017 model.\r\n\r\nIt has \r\nTwo USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports.\r\nOne USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A port.\r\nIR webcam for Windows Hello login and the webcam is on the top of the screen.\r\nA Webcam Kill Switch switch that disables the webcam, no need sticker.\r\nA MicroSD card reader.\r\nThe rest you can read from the specification page.\r\n\r\nIt also comes with an active pen and laptop sleeve.\r\nThankfully the power brick is only 3.5"" by 2"" small.\r\n\r\nFinally the laptop only weight 2.7 lb !!\r\n\r\nI am very happy with this laptop.', 'For years, I have avoided both 2in1 and small form factor laptops. Don’t get me wrong, I have always wanted one, but they always seemed to miss the mark. Compared to larger, non-touch alternatives, there were just too many sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThis time around though, the stars seemed to align, and the sacrifices have nearly disappeared... A small, effective form factor, with truly thin bezels, a windows hello camera, 4 core/8 Thread CPU, a good sized SSD, a good trackpad with windows precision drivers.... This list goes on and on. The one downside…. The RAM is NOT upgradeable. If you can, it may benefit you to purchase the higher end model to get 16GB of RAM.\r\n\r\nI have been using this laptop for a about a week now, and so far, I can say that I am glad I waited for this unit. My previous laptop, while still nice was an obtrusive experience, a burden to haul around. In an age where tablets and large smartphones sit front and center, it is refreshing that when I need to get actual work done, I can just grab this and go. Its thin, light, comfortable to use and fast. It just makes things easy.\r\n\r\nWith the current state of Windows 10, I am not convinced that a touch screen laptop is necessary, but I will say that it has been a nice feature to have. Sometimes it just makes sense to touch the screen or flip it over to use in tablet form. This isn’t going to replace a tablet, but it has been an enjoyable feature to have.\r\n\r\nThe interfaces of this laptop are great. It has a good, solid keyboard, a nice sized trackpad that has not been in the way. And speaking of the trackpad, it has a nice feel and uses Windows Precision Drivers. Finally! The 1080p IPS screen is great, and its glossy finish is appropriate for the touchscreen.\r\n\r\nThe performance is exactly what I was looking for. This computer screams through standard productivity tasks (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, etc), web browsing, streaming, etc…. Its powerful enough to handle applications like Adobe Premiere Elements, though its not a comparable experience to my beefier desktop PC.\r\n\r\nI’ve always enjoyed a bit of gaming, and I understand while this does not of a discrete GPU, the new Iris Plus graphics is supposed to be a big upgrade over the previous integrated graphics. So yeah, this is not a gaming laptop. But you might be able to enjoy some older and less demanding games with some sacrifices.\r\n\r\n- Rocket league: Even at 720P and “Performance” settings, the experience was not acceptable for an enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\n- Portal 2: I had to Lower to 900P and medium settings. The game wasn’t always fluid, but for the most part, it was able to hold 60 FPS and after 30 minutes went by, I had been pulled into the gaming experience and had forgotten I was just testing the capabilities of the computer.\r\n\r\n- Zwift (3D Cycling Simulator): It takes a bit for this game to load, but after that, it runs okay. At 1080p, you can almost hold 30 FPS. At 720p, it runs around 45-60 FPS.\r\n\r\nOverall, my first week with this laptop has been outstanding, and I highly recommend this laptop. The fact that this laptop still has a USB-A port, a headphone jack, and a Micro-SD slot, has made it to where I haven’t had to adjust my other equipment. That “little” detail is far more important to me than having a couple more USB-C/Thunderbolt ports.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Thin and light\r\n- Great Build Quality\r\n- Legacy Ports (USB-A, Headphone/Mic Jack, Micro SD card)\r\n- Good performance\r\n- Included accessories (Padded Sleeve and HP Tilt Pen)\r\nCons:\r\n- Non-Upgraded able RAM\r\n- Function Keys Default to the Secondary features and cannot be changed in the OS. I had to change this setting back in the BIOS\r\n- No discrete GPU', ""I have a 2016 Spectre x360 with the Kaby Lake chip set that I love, but it has a battery drain issue, so I was looking to replace it. This new Spectre does not disappoint. Open up the typical laptop box and you'll find a spiffy box inside that makes it feel like an Apple product. The build quality and design are excellent. I initially thought the corner cut-outs were a little strange, but I like that the power button sits on the corner as it’s each to find, but difficult to accidentally hit it. The one design choice I don’t like is the USB 3 port. Because the edge is double beveled, the USB port has a tab you need to move to access the port, which I can see getting snagged on something over time. I like the addition of the web camera on/off switch and the fingerprint reader. I like to have the camera turned off or covered, so having the fingerprint reader makes for a quick login without the camera. \r\n\r\nThe smaller bezel around the screen makes this Spectre’s screen 1 inch smaller, making the whole laptop smaller in that dimension. The Full HD screen’s quality is as expected, and the touch screen is accurate and in the past week has not shown any fingerprints with light touchscreen use. The smaller size doesn’t compromise the keyboard or touch pad through. The keyboard has a nice feel to it and I like how when you have the backlight on, it will turn off after a period of inactivity. The touch pad on my 2016 Spectre was the best I had used on a laptop. This new Spectre’s touch pad is even better. It is accurate and smooth. I can even use the two finger scroll effectively and smoothly without accidentally clicking on a link (which would happen on my old Spectre). \r\n\r\nFrom a Software perspective, this laptop doesn’t come with much, which is good. It has the HP JumpStart and HP Support Assistant software, plus McAfee, a couple of games, a VPN client and Dropbox. I like how it didn’t come too much software I would need to uninstall. \r\n\r\nI really like my 2016 Spectre x360, so I had high expectations for this laptop. This new Spectre x360 exceeded my expectations with the webcam on/off switch, fingerprint reader, improved touch pad and power button placement. There really isn’t much room for improvement, so this laptop easily earns 5 stars. \r\n\r\nPros\r\n- Build quality and attention to detail\r\n - Web Camera on/off switch\r\n - Fingerprint reader\r\n - Leatherette case, which includes a nice have Velcro flap and active pen slot \r\n\r\nCons: \r\n - Smaller bezel on a 360 degree touchscreen means more likelihood of accidentally hitting the X button, closing apps accidentally \r\n - Power cord is braided instead of a plastic cord, which will attract dust\r\n - USB 3 port’s hatch, although ascetically pleasing, may be prone to breakage"", 'I just purchased this laptop 3 days ago and yes its beautiful and functional but here are my concerns. I play Second Life and the FPS frames per second was lot slower than usual also I had to adjust my graphic settings and turn on the anti-aliasing to smooth the jagged lines in the game which I never need to do. The fan noise is loud and you must turn on the HP Command Center to quiet it down. And lastly while I was gaming the other night with the computer on a flat surface the heat melted the plastic trim on the rear of the lid. Needless to say I will be returning it...its a shame because the lid should have been all solid with no plastic anything. Otherwise I would keep it.', '')"
6376413 ,"('Coming from a Surface Pro 3, which I\'ve enjoyed, this beats it on every way for me.

6364578 ,"(""Cons – Screen lacks saturation. Low-volume speakers.\nPros – Good machine for the $750 sales price in terms of speed and horsepower.\n\nThe Good-----------\nI do intensive illustration/graphic design work, so I took a gamble on a unit with no dedicated graphics card hoping the SSD and 12gb ram might reasonably compensate. So far, it has. My largest Photoshop file is around 10gb. Upon opening it, things mostly zipped along, whereas it would bring my previous core i7 laptop to a crawl. On this x360 there was some momentary lag in Photoshop performance after the file first opened, but that soon passed and everything ran smooth, even when I tested some of Photoshop's most lag-producing brushes at very large sizes.\nNow the thing is, even though the momentary lag disappeared and the performance was fast and smooth, task manager still showed me at about 97% in memory consumption, which then settled down to 77%. Must be a testament to the hardware to have smooth performance at 97% memory usage, but still, you don't want things that high. But that troubling detail is balanced out by the ability to increase ram memory (from the installed 12gb) to 32gb, and I don't regularly work with design files as large as 10gb anyway. By comparison, Photoshop performance with every other design file sped right along without spiking memory. Illustrator and InDesign worked without a hitch as well.\nSo I'm thrilled at the speed I'm getting off this PC, even with a ton of browser windows open and graphic software running.\n************\n\nThe Bad ---------------\n1) Sound quality of the built-in speakers is good but NOT the volume! Compared to the Beats speakers in my old HP PC, these x360 speakers just whisper. And there's no equalizer to adjust the volume - there used to be, but not now. HP removed the equalizer for Windows compatibility reasons, and there's no word on when or if they'll put one back in. I can grab some headphones, but this is still a disappointment.  \n\n2) The SCREEN is the one BIG Con.....for artists.\nThe brightness level is a noticeable downgrade from my HP Envy from 2012. But it's not so bad that I couldn't get use to it. The worst for me are the muted colors of this screen. Most people wouldn't even notice, but for artists and others who REALLY pay attention to color, this flaw sticks out. And frustratingly, HP tech support are not being supplied a lot of the finer spec details when it comes to this x360 model. I had to dig long and hard myself to find out that the screen is only hitting about 67% of the sRGB. Certain colors like red could show so vibrantly on my 7 year old PC that it burned your eyes if you stared. Not so on the x360. On this unit, reds are muted and could look dangerously close to orange. Fortunately for me, I happen to have other monitors to view my work through. But if I were solely reliant on this x360 screen alone, it would be a huge problem. And if I had paid $1,000 rather than the $750 early Black Friday price, I’d be significantly more upset now.  But price and performance speed are just enough to offset my disappointment with screen quality.  If you’re an artist needing exact colors, you have to use another monitor in conjunction to this x360. \nThe last mention concerns the tablet functionality. I do not yet own a pen for this x360, but many hours of research tells me the HP Tilt Pen is more optimized for this screen and to skip the other 3rd party pens like the Bamboo pen. The 3rd party pens give you shakier lines on this thing. Despite the disappointing color gamut, it’s still good enough to use as a painting tablet.\n\n*****************\n\nIf you have more money, buy a laptop with a better screen. If you buy this unit be prepared to use external speakers or headphones. And tech support is good, but HP has given them limited information about this machine…..so dealing with x360 support can get frustrating if you’re trying to gain info not already present in the online manuals. It’s shocking how little info HP currently provides on this machine and peripherals like the HP Tilt Pen (which is why I won’t truly know if tilt functionality will work on this unit until I get the pen)."", ""This is a great laptop.  I’m in the IT industry and I only buy HP laptops for myself.  Every HP I’ve owned was still working when I upgraded to a new one.  I just gave my wife my 10-year-old HP laptop and it works like the day I bought it.   This new Envy X360 did not disappoint.  I can’t believe how thin it is!  With the lid closed, the whole thing is about the same thickness as just the screen on my old laptop.\n\nHP did a nice job designing this one.  Feels comfortable and sturdy.  Everything worked right out of the box.  Any of us who have bought computers over the years knows that a new computer normally needs updates, fixes, and tweaks to get everything working right.  Not this one.  I haven’t touched it other than customizing it for my needs and receiving the automatic updates to Windows 10.  The fingerprint reader is nice because you only need to lay your finger on it.  My old one I had to slide my finger across it.  Sound is very nice and has a good bass quality.  I also love the camera ‘kill’ switch.  I’m not a social media person and I don’t like video calling, so every time I buy a new device; I always find a way to cover the camera so it can’t be used.  This one has a hard switch that shuts off the camera.  Nice!   I like that the power cord end that plugs into the computer is L-shaped, so it doesn’t stick out too far.  Also, this computer is quiet.  I have to listen closely to hear the fan running and it doesn’t seem to get too warm. 12 GB of RAM and the SSD drive make startup and opening apps nearly instant.  There’s a very short boot time that’s almost unnoticeable (at least in my configuration).  I press the power button and it almost instantly is to the logon screen.  I touch the fingerprint reader and the desktop appears.  Can’t ask for anything better than that.  One other thing I’d like to mention is the clarity of the screen.  Even though this has a smaller screen than my old 17” laptop, this one is so clear that it seems to be easier on my eyes.  At least for me it is.\n\nA note about Windows 10….  In the old days, I wasn't a fan of Microsoft constantly changing Windows versions.  But windows 10 has gotten better over time.  I normally use Ubuntu as my operating system of choice, but I think I’m going to keep Windows 10 on this computer.  I like how Windows 10 now has a decent functioning multiple desktop feature.  Also, settings don’t seem as difficult to find in this version.  \n\nTo sum it up, I really don’t have anything negative to say about this.  Once again HP comes through for me!"", 'I bought this for business travel.  The SSD storage is much faster and more efficient than the old hard drives.  The 12gb of RAM helps too.  Boot up in Windows 10 is only a few seconds and another feature that I needed is the good number of outputs.  It has ports for HDMI, 2 USBs, 1 USBc and a slot for SD Cards.  It is larger than my older Surface Pro but the added media outputs is sometimes needed for meetings.\n\nI have run it for extended periods of time and the battery life is very good.   With low activity, the battery only went down by 20% over a 5 hour period.  It no doubt would draw down more if I was very active but I am sure that it could last a workday without problems.  No problems with anything so far.', 'I\'ve been purchasing HP Envys for our company for a little over 4 years now. The 17"" is a bit ridiculous in size, but some of our instructors are of the age where they need a larger screen for when they need larger font to read. I feel the 15"" is the optimal size. The pavilions just seem to have to many issues that I don\'t want to be spending time trying to remedy. I\'ve had very little issues with the Envys and now that they have finger print logon and SSD for fast boot up and programs it just makes it even more convenient and faster. I dont feel this model is any faster than its predecessor, but it was on sale and sales are always good! The feel of this model is good. The touchpad feels good.

6301869 ,"(""I have been using Chromebooks since the originals came out in 2011. I used them personally and my students used them as their school computers (I'm a High School teacher). I have always been on the fence about them. They are great for research and collaboration, but early on the lack of anything really beyond the suite of Google programs kind of boxed them in. They also tended to be wildly underpowered to do much of any multi-tasking (heck, some were even brought to their knees by multi-tabbing in Chrome).\r\n\r\nI've been really excited to see the push towards more powerful Chromebooks with better processors, screens, build-quality, and software. Google's Pixelbook was and is a phenomenal machine but was priced a bit too high. Other companies like HP have done an outstanding job of dialing back the price but still maintaining a phenomenal quality level.\r\n\r\nWhile this x360 only has a Core i3, that is like an i7 for a Windows box. That and the 8gb of DDR4 RAM, make this thing a beast when it comes to general everyday work and some fun video watching as well. The keyboard is great, with a really nice feel while typing. I have a little two-line blurb that I always use to test out whether or not I like a keyboard and depending on how many typos I make, I can usually get a good feel if I will like it in the long run. Only had one typo on this keyboard which is outstanding because I type incredibly fast and one or two typos happens on the best keyboards! The trackpad is spacious and responsive, though I still hate trackpads and I have a bluetooth mouse that I use with this and it works great.\r\n\r\nAs for software, now that Chrome has MS Office apps and other non-Google offerings, this is an incredibly versatile computer. While the Google suite is great for collaboration, Microsoft has also made great strides in boosting the ability to collaborate through Office and I much prefer my students to do presentations and such in PowerPoint than in Slides. I think MS Office is much more versatile (though the Google apps are getting better), and I think MS Office skills are an important skill for students to learn. Students nowadays may be incredibly skilled in social media but you would be surprised at how lacking they are in actually using many mainstream programs. I absolutely blow their minds when I show them how Word can do a bibliography for them.\r\n\r\nThe number of ports is great with a USB-C port on either side that can also be used as the power port. This is actually one of my favorite things about the move to USB-C is that more and more manufacturers make it easy to have the power cord go to either side. I wouldn't buy a computer in the past that had the power plug on the right since it typically interfered with my mouse usage. I know lefties that don't like it on the right since they often have notebooks or other things on that side of the computer. I'm a lefty too but I don't write anymore (my handwriting is atrocious and I have since learned just to type things up really, really fast). The HP x360 also has a USB-A plug which makes it easy to use thumb-drives and other peripherals. Also included in a micro-SD slot which makes storage a non issue for this computer. While it has 64gb of eMMC storage, I have all my files either in the cloud or on my SD card (typically both). 128gb micro-SD cards are incredibly cheap nowadays and so storage is virtually unlimited for this thing.\r\n\r\nI have only two complaints for this as a student laptop: \r\n\r\n1 - It is a lot heavier than the basic Chromebooks. Not ridiculously so, but when you are already lugging a ton of books, every little bit counts. That being said, it is because this thing is built so well that it is as hefty as it is. I would much rather it be built well and weigh more than it be made of plastic and break easily. If this computer is mostly going to stay stationary on a desk, this becomes a non-issue as well.\r\n\r\n2 - The lid of this thing is white and beautiful with a really nice texture to it. It is also going to get dirty beyond belief. I haven't gotten it dirty yet, so I don't know how easy it will be to clean and I don't feel like testing it out just to see. I would have been happy with the Cloud Blue all over, though the white lid and cloud blue deck is really nice.\r\n\r\nIf you have a student that needs a great computer that is going to be able to handle pretty much anything you throw at it (short of games of course), this is an outstanding choice. If you are just a casual computer user and just want a nice laptop with a really good keyboard that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, the HP x360 is a great choice. Kuddos to HP for making a Chromebook that I can unequivocally endorse for my students."", ""My experience with Chromebooks over the last few years has been limited, but informative. I never really cared for how cheap the devices felt, or how limited the Chrome OS felt. The Chromebooks were often underpowered, necessitated by their low price points, and felt like an unnecessary compromise to a cheap Windows based laptop. You could reasonably get a better experience on a mid-range Android phone in some cases, albeit on a small screen. In comes the HP x360 Convertible 2-in-1 Chromebook. It is a premium 14” Chromebook that slots into a higher price point than Chromebooks of old, but more accessible than the new ultra-premium Chromebooks like the Pixelbook.\r\n\r\nSpecs\r\n\r\nCPU – Intel (8th Gen) i3-8130U Dual Core 2.20 GHz processor w/ integrated Intel 620 graphics\r\nMemory – 8GB DDR4-2666\r\nScreen – 14” 1920 x 1080p HD IPS\r\nStorage – 64GB Flash memory – microSD card port available for additional 512GB expansion\r\nPorts – 2X USB C / 1X USB 3.0 / microSD Slot / TRRS 3.5mm Jack (headphone and mic support)\r\nAudio – Bang & Olufsen PLAY dual speakers\r\nWebcam – 720P with dual microphone\r\nDimensions – 12.81 x 8.93 x 0.63”; 3.7lb\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n\r\nThe design of the x360 Convertible is exceedingly nice. I was impressed when I first pulled it out of the box, and it had some weight to it. It didn’t feel cheap at all. The white outer shell looks fantastic, and its sleek profile reminds me more of a Surface Book or Mac Book than a Chromebook. Bravo HP. The Ceramic White outer shell doesn’t appear especially prone to getting dirty or smudging, which I was worried about. Once you open it up you are greeted by an interior finished in what HP calls Cloud Blue. Its not really blue, but more of gray blue. Nonetheless it looks very sleek and has a great feel to it. Again, no sign of it feeling like a low-cost Chromebook. The interior is made of soft touch plastic that has a very light texture to it – almost like a sandblasted metal. This surface completely resists smudges and fingerprints, which is great since this is where your hand will be going all the time. \r\n\r\nThe conversion from laptop to tablet is seamless. The hinge provides the right amount of resistance to allow the main body and screen to be used at any number of angles and configurations. The keyboard and trackpad are disabled early enough in the transition to keep errant clicks and button pushes from happening. In tablet mode, the thickness of the machine increases to 0.74” at it thickest points (furthest from the hinges). Like most 2-in-1’s figuring out how you want to hold it in tablet mode take a few minutes to get use to. You are either clicking the trackpad, covering the speakers a bit, or pressing keys. This is inherent to every convertible I have used, so it just takes a few minutes to get comfortable with how you want to hold it.\r\n\r\nThe ports are pretty well laid out on the body. I like that the 2 USB C ports are on either side so you can use whichever side is most convenient to you when charging. My only nag with the overall design is in the microSD slot. I added an expansion card, and it bugs me that the card sticks out from the edge like it does. It breaks up the nice clean edge of the body and makes it easy to accidently eject. I would have liked to see it concealed with a cover. Regardless that is a small ding.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n\r\nThe dual core i3 is a pretty light weight, efficient processor. It will get bogged down if you throw too much at it, but it was plenty snappy with just a handful of active apps. For Chrome OS you don’t need a ton of computational horsepower to have a fast machine, so the dual core seems to be plenty. The 8GB of RAM is what is more important, and that’s what keeps the x360 feeling quick. Most Chromebooks around this price point only carry 4 GB of memory, so the x360 has a leg up here. \r\n\r\nDisplay\r\n\r\nThe 14” 1920 X 1080p FHD IPS touchscreen display looks great. It has a high gloss finish like you would expect in today’s touchscreens. The only Chromebooks with higher resolution have a smaller screen (12.3”) and cost considerably more (MSRP of $1K+). So for this Chromebook the 14” 1080p touchscreen is all you can reasonably ask for. The screen clarity, and sharpness were pleasing to the eye, and the colors had a good amount of pop to them. I watched a lot of Netflix on this, and I was very pleased with the image reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe multipoint touchscreen is very responsive, and easy to use. I found it to be accurate when registering my inputs. It also didn’t get overwhelmed by my kids playing fruit ninja, and swiping at it like crazed 4 & 5 year-olds are want to do. Overall, the screen is great, although it does pick up every finger print due to the gloss finish.\r\n\r\nKeyboard and Trackpad\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is a ten-keyless design (no number pad) with body color match keys. The keys have a white backlight that comes in handy for typing in the dark. The keys have a relatively short throw with a full travel length of 0.04” and low to mid force requirement. The key actuation is soft and muted with the actuation point right at the top of the key travel. I found the key throw length to be a little too shallow for my tastes, and it slightly impacting my typing. I typically type on a mechanical keyboard with Cherry Brown switches, so swapping over to a laptop keyboard is always an adjustment. In this case I never got fully comfortable with the keyboard, though others that I let try it had no issues adjusting.\r\n\r\nThe trackpad is a delight to use. It is also body color matched with a satin surface texture. I usually dislike most trackpads, but this was truly nice to use. The multipoint touch was accurate, and the trackpad was responsive. I had no issues navigating around, and if something did get tricky I was able to fall back to the display touchscreen.\r\n\r\nBattery Life\r\n\r\nThe advertised battery life is 14hrs. In my use I found that an hour of Netflix drained about 10% with the screen on full brightness. So 10hrs of streaming video at max brightness is pretty good in my opinion. Slide that brightness down, and I could easily get a couple more hours. Standby power usage was excellent. A full day of of no use in standby only dropped the battery a percent or 2. I didn't time it exactly but from 2% battery to full charge was done in under 2 hours. Thats's plenty quick enough for me.\r\n\r\nSound\r\n\r\nThe sound from the B&O PLAY dual speakers is quite good for a laptop. There is no bass or real low end, which I expected. The mids and highs were bright and clear, and the speakers had enough sound to fill a room. In tablet mode I expected the speakers to get muffled when placed on my lap but were oddly unaffected. Overall HP and B&O did a good job on the speakers.\r\n\r\nWebcam\r\n\r\nI have used HP webcams in the past, and they had generally been kind of bad. A $20 Logitech webcam was better than the old ones. I used the webcam during several Skype calls, and found that the camera in the x360 to be pretty good. The people I was calling told me my picture was perfectly clear. The only time I ran into problems was with low light. The camera sensor isn’t large enough to get a good picture in low light. You really need a well-lit room. The dual mics also, weren’t the best. The other people on the call said it sounded tinny, but clear. They remarked that my normal camera had a far grainier picture but had much better sound. My old camera is a Logitech TV Cam (720p with dual mics) from 8 years ago. \r\n\r\nOverall,\r\n\r\nI am impressed with the x360 convertible. It is a huge leap in quality over Chromebooks of the past. HP really knocked the design out and made a premium feeling laptop. The machine feels quick and responsive and pleasing to use. I never felt frustrated with its performance or its feature set. This is the first Chromebook I have picked up that feels like a reasonable alternative to a Windows based machine. If have used to the Android Ecosystem you will already be familiar with how the Chrome OS works. Sure it lacks some of the programs, robustness, and support that Windows offers. For web browsing, word processing, app based games, etc Chrome OS is perfectly capable of meeting your needs. In short, if you are in the market for a quick premium feeling laptop you might want to check this one out."", ""I have had the pleasure of using this HP Chromebook over the weekend and so far it has been a great experience. I am thoroughly pleased with this particular model that HP has released.\r\n\r\nNow lets breakdown why you should consider getting this particular model if you are looking to buy a Chromebook. I have been using CB for around two years and it has gotten better overtime and now that it offers Android support CB sales have taken off and now it seems everyone is making a CB. \r\n\r\nI have used a few different CB from different manufacturers my top two being HP & Samsung. But I find myself leaning a lot more in favor of HP they really have been making some nice CB like the previous CB that is detachable. I prefer this 2 in 1 design because it is practical for my use. \r\n\r\nNow this model has a Full HD screen in a 16:9 ratio which is great in comparison to some of the 3:2 ratio screens it is just better in my opinion. The 14 inch screen is plenty bright and is the ideal size for any use whether for media or word processing purposes. The panel is touchscreen so that is a definite plus.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is a full sized keyboard and it is back lit. I love the feel of the keys they have a nice feel to them and have great travel and don't feel spongy nor do they stick. It makes for a great typing experience and I did not miss any keys which is good for those who value accuracy. The track pad is responsive and accurate clicks and touch register as it should so there are no complaints there. \r\n\r\nThe CB is very aesthetically pleasing with the two tone design. It is made of what seems to be a plastic and aluminum.

6365772 ,"(""I have been using Chromebooks since the originals came out in 2011. I used them personally and my students used them as their school computers (I'm a High School teacher). I have always been on the fence about them. They are great for research and collaboration, but early on the lack of anything really beyond the suite of Google programs kind of boxed them in. They also tended to be wildly underpowered to do much of any multi-tasking (heck, some were even brought to their knees by multi-tabbing in Chrome).\r\n\r\nI've been really excited to see the push towards more powerful Chromebooks with better processors, screens, build-quality, and software. Google's Pixelbook was and is a phenomenal machine but was priced a bit too high. Other companies like HP have done an outstanding job of dialing back the price but still maintaining a phenomenal quality level.\r\n\r\nWhile this x360 only has a Core i3, that is like an i7 for a Windows box. That and the 8gb of DDR4 RAM, make this thing a beast when it comes to general everyday work and some fun video watching as well. The keyboard is great, with a really nice feel while typing. I have a little two-line blurb that I always use to test out whether or not I like a keyboard and depending on how many typos I make, I can usually get a good feel if I will like it in the long run. Only had one typo on this keyboard which is outstanding because I type incredibly fast and one or two typos happens on the best keyboards! The trackpad is spacious and responsive, though I still hate trackpads and I have a bluetooth mouse that I use with this and it works great.\r\n\r\nAs for software, now that Chrome has MS Office apps and other non-Google offerings, this is an incredibly versatile computer. While the Google suite is great for collaboration, Microsoft has also made great strides in boosting the ability to collaborate through Office and I much prefer my students to do presentations and such in PowerPoint than in Slides. I think MS Office is much more versatile (though the Google apps are getting better), and I think MS Office skills are an important skill for students to learn. Students nowadays may be incredibly skilled in social media but you would be surprised at how lacking they are in actually using many mainstream programs. I absolutely blow their minds when I show them how Word can do a bibliography for them.\r\n\r\nThe number of ports is great with a USB-C port on either side that can also be used as the power port. This is actually one of my favorite things about the move to USB-C is that more and more manufacturers make it easy to have the power cord go to either side. I wouldn't buy a computer in the past that had the power plug on the right since it typically interfered with my mouse usage. I know lefties that don't like it on the right since they often have notebooks or other things on that side of the computer. I'm a lefty too but I don't write anymore (my handwriting is atrocious and I have since learned just to type things up really, really fast). The HP x360 also has a USB-A plug which makes it easy to use thumb-drives and other peripherals. Also included in a micro-SD slot which makes storage a non issue for this computer. While it has 64gb of eMMC storage, I have all my files either in the cloud or on my SD card (typically both). 128gb micro-SD cards are incredibly cheap nowadays and so storage is virtually unlimited for this thing.\r\n\r\nI have only two complaints for this as a student laptop: \r\n\r\n1 - It is a lot heavier than the basic Chromebooks. Not ridiculously so, but when you are already lugging a ton of books, every little bit counts. That being said, it is because this thing is built so well that it is as hefty as it is. I would much rather it be built well and weigh more than it be made of plastic and break easily. If this computer is mostly going to stay stationary on a desk, this becomes a non-issue as well.\r\n\r\n2 - The lid of this thing is white and beautiful with a really nice texture to it. It is also going to get dirty beyond belief. I haven't gotten it dirty yet, so I don't know how easy it will be to clean and I don't feel like testing it out just to see. I would have been happy with the Cloud Blue all over, though the white lid and cloud blue deck is really nice.\r\n\r\nIf you have a student that needs a great computer that is going to be able to handle pretty much anything you throw at it (short of games of course), this is an outstanding choice. If you are just a casual computer user and just want a nice laptop with a really good keyboard that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, the HP x360 is a great choice. Kuddos to HP for making a Chromebook that I can unequivocally endorse for my students."", ""My experience with Chromebooks over the last few years has been limited, but informative. I never really cared for how cheap the devices felt, or how limited the Chrome OS felt. The Chromebooks were often underpowered, necessitated by their low price points, and felt like an unnecessary compromise to a cheap Windows based laptop. You could reasonably get a better experience on a mid-range Android phone in some cases, albeit on a small screen. In comes the HP x360 Convertible 2-in-1 Chromebook. It is a premium 14” Chromebook that slots into a higher price point than Chromebooks of old, but more accessible than the new ultra-premium Chromebooks like the Pixelbook.\r\n\r\nSpecs\r\n\r\nCPU – Intel (8th Gen) i3-8130U Dual Core 2.20 GHz processor w/ integrated Intel 620 graphics\r\nMemory – 8GB DDR4-2666\r\nScreen – 14” 1920 x 1080p HD IPS\r\nStorage – 64GB Flash memory – microSD card port available for additional 512GB expansion\r\nPorts – 2X USB C / 1X USB 3.0 / microSD Slot / TRRS 3.5mm Jack (headphone and mic support)\r\nAudio – Bang & Olufsen PLAY dual speakers\r\nWebcam – 720P with dual microphone\r\nDimensions – 12.81 x 8.93 x 0.63”; 3.7lb\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n\r\nThe design of the x360 Convertible is exceedingly nice. I was impressed when I first pulled it out of the box, and it had some weight to it. It didn’t feel cheap at all. The white outer shell looks fantastic, and its sleek profile reminds me more of a Surface Book or Mac Book than a Chromebook. Bravo HP. The Ceramic White outer shell doesn’t appear especially prone to getting dirty or smudging, which I was worried about. Once you open it up you are greeted by an interior finished in what HP calls Cloud Blue. Its not really blue, but more of gray blue. Nonetheless it looks very sleek and has a great feel to it. Again, no sign of it feeling like a low-cost Chromebook. The interior is made of soft touch plastic that has a very light texture to it – almost like a sandblasted metal. This surface completely resists smudges and fingerprints, which is great since this is where your hand will be going all the time. \r\n\r\nThe conversion from laptop to tablet is seamless. The hinge provides the right amount of resistance to allow the main body and screen to be used at any number of angles and configurations. The keyboard and trackpad are disabled early enough in the transition to keep errant clicks and button pushes from happening. In tablet mode, the thickness of the machine increases to 0.74” at it thickest points (furthest from the hinges). Like most 2-in-1’s figuring out how you want to hold it in tablet mode take a few minutes to get use to. You are either clicking the trackpad, covering the speakers a bit, or pressing keys. This is inherent to every convertible I have used, so it just takes a few minutes to get comfortable with how you want to hold it.\r\n\r\nThe ports are pretty well laid out on the body. I like that the 2 USB C ports are on either side so you can use whichever side is most convenient to you when charging. My only nag with the overall design is in the microSD slot. I added an expansion card, and it bugs me that the card sticks out from the edge like it does. It breaks up the nice clean edge of the body and makes it easy to accidently eject. I would have liked to see it concealed with a cover. Regardless that is a small ding.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n\r\nThe dual core i3 is a pretty light weight, efficient processor. It will get bogged down if you throw too much at it, but it was plenty snappy with just a handful of active apps. For Chrome OS you don’t need a ton of computational horsepower to have a fast machine, so the dual core seems to be plenty. The 8GB of RAM is what is more important, and that’s what keeps the x360 feeling quick. Most Chromebooks around this price point only carry 4 GB of memory, so the x360 has a leg up here. \r\n\r\nDisplay\r\n\r\nThe 14” 1920 X 1080p FHD IPS touchscreen display looks great. It has a high gloss finish like you would expect in today’s touchscreens. The only Chromebooks with higher resolution have a smaller screen (12.3”) and cost considerably more (MSRP of $1K+). So for this Chromebook the 14” 1080p touchscreen is all you can reasonably ask for. The screen clarity, and sharpness were pleasing to the eye, and the colors had a good amount of pop to them. I watched a lot of Netflix on this, and I was very pleased with the image reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe multipoint touchscreen is very responsive, and easy to use. I found it to be accurate when registering my inputs. It also didn’t get overwhelmed by my kids playing fruit ninja, and swiping at it like crazed 4 & 5 year-olds are want to do. Overall, the screen is great, although it does pick up every finger print due to the gloss finish.\r\n\r\nKeyboard and Trackpad\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is a ten-keyless design (no number pad) with body color match keys. The keys have a white backlight that comes in handy for typing in the dark. The keys have a relatively short throw with a full travel length of 0.04” and low to mid force requirement. The key actuation is soft and muted with the actuation point right at the top of the key travel. I found the key throw length to be a little too shallow for my tastes, and it slightly impacting my typing. I typically type on a mechanical keyboard with Cherry Brown switches, so swapping over to a laptop keyboard is always an adjustment. In this case I never got fully comfortable with the keyboard, though others that I let try it had no issues adjusting.\r\n\r\nThe trackpad is a delight to use. It is also body color matched with a satin surface texture. I usually dislike most trackpads, but this was truly nice to use. The multipoint touch was accurate, and the trackpad was responsive. I had no issues navigating around, and if something did get tricky I was able to fall back to the display touchscreen.\r\n\r\nBattery Life\r\n\r\nThe advertised battery life is 14hrs. In my use I found that an hour of Netflix drained about 10% with the screen on full brightness. So 10hrs of streaming video at max brightness is pretty good in my opinion. Slide that brightness down, and I could easily get a couple more hours. Standby power usage was excellent. A full day of of no use in standby only dropped the battery a percent or 2. I didn't time it exactly but from 2% battery to full charge was done in under 2 hours. Thats's plenty quick enough for me.\r\n\r\nSound\r\n\r\nThe sound from the B&O PLAY dual speakers is quite good for a laptop. There is no bass or real low end, which I expected. The mids and highs were bright and clear, and the speakers had enough sound to fill a room. In tablet mode I expected the speakers to get muffled when placed on my lap but were oddly unaffected. Overall HP and B&O did a good job on the speakers.\r\n\r\nWebcam\r\n\r\nI have used HP webcams in the past, and they had generally been kind of bad. A $20 Logitech webcam was better than the old ones. I used the webcam during several Skype calls, and found that the camera in the x360 to be pretty good. The people I was calling told me my picture was perfectly clear. The only time I ran into problems was with low light. The camera sensor isn’t large enough to get a good picture in low light. You really need a well-lit room. The dual mics also, weren’t the best. The other people on the call said it sounded tinny, but clear. They remarked that my normal camera had a far grainier picture but had much better sound. My old camera is a Logitech TV Cam (720p with dual mics) from 8 years ago. \r\n\r\nOverall,\r\n\r\nI am impressed with the x360 convertible. It is a huge leap in quality over Chromebooks of the past. HP really knocked the design out and made a premium feeling laptop. The machine feels quick and responsive and pleasing to use. I never felt frustrated with its performance or its feature set. This is the first Chromebook I have picked up that feels like a reasonable alternative to a Windows based machine. If have used to the Android Ecosystem you will already be familiar with how the Chrome OS works. Sure it lacks some of the programs, robustness, and support that Windows offers. For web browsing, word processing, app based games, etc Chrome OS is perfectly capable of meeting your needs. In short, if you are in the market for a quick premium feeling laptop you might want to check this one out."", ""I have had the pleasure of using this HP Chromebook over the weekend and so far it has been a great experience. I am thoroughly pleased with this particular model that HP has released.\r\n\r\nNow lets breakdown why you should consider getting this particular model if you are looking to buy a Chromebook. I have been using CB for around two years and it has gotten better overtime and now that it offers Android support CB sales have taken off and now it seems everyone is making a CB. \r\n\r\nI have used a few different CB from different manufacturers my top two being HP & Samsung. But I find myself leaning a lot more in favor of HP they really have been making some nice CB like the previous CB that is detachable. I prefer this 2 in 1 design because it is practical for my use. \r\n\r\nNow this model has a Full HD screen in a 16:9 ratio which is great in comparison to some of the 3:2 ratio screens it is just better in my opinion. The 14 inch screen is plenty bright and is the ideal size for any use whether for media or word processing purposes. The panel is touchscreen so that is a definite plus.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is a full sized keyboard and it is back lit. I love the feel of the keys they have a nice feel to them and have great travel and don't feel spongy nor do they stick. It makes for a great typing experience and I did not miss any keys which is good for those who value accuracy. The track pad is responsive and accurate clicks and touch register as it should so there are no complaints there. \r\n\r\nThe CB is very aesthetically pleasing with the two tone design. It is made of what seems to be a plastic and aluminum. And if I am not mistaken it may have some sort of coating that helps it resist fingerprints to a certain extent, I really do like that it is not a finger print magnet because I am very particular on that it truly bugs me when a fine crafted product is a finger print magnet and I am constantly having to wipe it clean.\r\n\r\nThe speakers are not under the device and I also appreciate that.

This CB has an Intel Core i3 under the hood that is very fast dual core that has a base speed of 2.2 GHz and can run at a max of 4GHz now for a CB that is impressive. I have not been able to slow it down yet I have opened 25 chrome tabs and it does not even finch like my previous CB with a paltry 4GB of RAM. There are plenty of ports a full sized USB port and two USB C type and that is plenty for most users. a Micro SD slot is great for memory expansion.

My only gripe with this is that it is 64GB and that space will fill up fast now that Google Play apps are now for the most part compatible. Play apps compatibility that is up to each app developer but with each passing day more apps are compatible with CB.\r\n\r\nBattery life now it is a day and night difference from my previous CB and I am really impressed. I have only charged this device once and that was on Friday. It has been on standby since and I have used it for a total of roughly eight hours and I still have 37% battery life left and according to the OS it has approximately 4 & 1/2 hours of battery left. I could not get anywhere near that kind of battery life with my old Samsung CB. \r\n\r\n:::Pros:::\r\n\r\n- Back lit keyboard\r\n- Large 16:9 display (FHD but can view 1440p content)\r\n- Superb battery life\r\n- Upgrade able storage (with the use of a micro sd card)\r\n- Nice two tone design that feels premium\r\n- Small design & lightweight for its size (less than 4lbs)\r\n- Special coating that resists fingerprints\r\n- B&O speakers (good amount of bass for this device)\r\n\r\n:::Cons:::\r\n\r\n- 64GB of storage\r\n\r\nI am really happy with this Chromebook it is nearly perfect.

6353352 ,"(""First of all, to answer some of the questions and misinformation about this computer, the processor in this computer is almost the same performance as the 5th Gen Core i5 mobile processors. So if anyone says the Intel Gold 4417U CPU is slow, they're wrong. It's VERY capable and power efficient!\nSecondly, the computer comes installed with one 4GB ram module. I opened mine to replace it with an 8GB module but noticed there are TWO RAM SLOTS. I also wondered if I could actually install and use more than the 8GB max that the spec sheet specifies. So, I left the 4GB samsung DDR4-2666 Module installed (which is surprisingly good memory) and I installed the additional 8GB Patriot Viper DDR4-2666 module in the second slot. Well, it worked JUST FINE. I am running 12GB ram and windows displays and confirms 12GB DDR4 2400 (max speed cpu supports) installed. I was astonished and very pleseantly surprised that this $199 laptop is running performance class RAM and has accepted 12GB of it, so far. (I might try to replace the 4GB module with another 8GB for 16gb, but 12gb should be MORE than enough.)\nThird, this laptop has USB 3.1 and USB type-C which is practically unheard of in this price point, and even price points a couple hundred dollars higher.\nFourth, the SSD in this laptop interface is M.2 SSD and it's Samsung brand. I was also highly surprised to find an M.2 SSD in this $199 laptop and not SATA or something less expensive. Another very pleasant surprise and leaves LOTS of room for upgrade potential!\nAlso, the wifi adapter is m.2 pci-e 802.11n BUT is easily upgradable to newer tech (802.11ac and beyond) very inexpensively should that need come in the future, as it's not integrated into the motherboard.\nAlso, the display on this laptop may not be 1080p resolution, but it's sharp and vivid and bright and leaves nothing to be desired. If you don't believe me, go look at one for yourself on display at your local best buy. It's a FAR BETTER IPS display than is usually offered in super cheap price points like this!\n\nBottom line, adding a $40 8GB memory module to this laptop, and you have a VERY DECENT and capable portable machine that can do essentially anything you need to do apart from high-end gaming, obviously. In all honesty, people pay $400-$500 and more for the EXACT SAME performance that this laptop will bring you for just $199... and I'm not just saying that. It's REALLY NICE!"", 'The 4 gig memory is good for multiple window use. And the 128 gig for storage is also good for documents, photos, videos and music. The solid state drive (ssd) is great for quiet operation and fast start up. If you need additional storage just get an external micro sd card and use a low profile memory card adapter. Just pop it in an leave it there unlike a regular sd card or regular micro sd adapter, whis stick out like a sore thumb!', 'Out of the box this thing is pretty fast even though there’s only a pentium gold processor.   That’s faster than a intel celeron processor though.  The SSD is great also.  However, in the month I’ve had it I’ve made some serious upgrades to it on my own.  It now has two Samsung Evo 860 500Gb SSD, 16gb RAM, and an Intel wireless AC WLAN card.  Paid $200 for it during a Labor Day sale and now it’s easily a $600 laptop.   Would highly recommend this PC as it’s highly upgradable.', 'So, firstly, this is NOT a gaming machine! I hope that the people considering this laptop is understanding that fact. It cannot compare to high-end laptops and should not be compared to the laptops that boast Nvidia graphic cards. I knew what I was looking for in a small laptop and this is the perfect match for my needs. I already have an Asus ROG 17inch laptop that is over the top, but lugging this beast around college was really frustrating! It weighs around 7.5 pounds and the power brick probably is 2 lbs itself! I kept thinking that if I could just find something that would read emails, load Office apps (Word, Outlook, and Excel) and log into library ebooks, then I was going to get something else soon. Well, I found this on sale and never looked back! My Asus ROG will stay home and be used for games and music, whereas this little laptop will be with me for college. So, I clean installed Windows 10 pro and updated all drivers, and it is the best little purchase I have made this year. It is actually my ""go-to"" computer for everything, whether looking for recipes during dinner to watching YouTube videos while eating lunch. I streamed Netflix for 3 hours while having it on my lap and it never really felt hot, maybe lukewarm, but not hot. I would never, ever try that with my Asus! The heat coming out of that beast will roast your skin after 20 minutes. Again, this HP 14inch laptop can do everything that I need it to do. It is a small SSD of 128 GB but i still have 95 GB left after installing Win10 pro and Office Pro 2016. I do not plan to store music or pictures on it, so I do not think that i will have to upgrade the HDD. But it might not be enough if you are putting music and photos on there. I do think upgrading the RAM will be necessary, cause it is only 4 GB right now. So, I will looking into placing another 8gb in there to make it 12 GB DDR4. I read that someone was able to do that and it worked fine. \n\nIf you are purchasing a second laptop for business or coursework at college, this is the best choice. The laptop is so quiet, and it barely is heard, even when running multiple browsers and Word. The screen is not 1080p, but I knew that and honestly, the screen is nice, with sharp details and vivid color. I am not watching 4K movies on this thing, so screen is not a huge factor. To add Windows 10 pro or home edition, you have to tweak the BIOS setting and place it in Legacy mode. It took a little time to understand how to boot to USB.', 'Bought it for my wife opened it up, pow, its has a extra dim slot throw an 8gb in that $30 done. Wait an empty 2.5 drive slot let buy the ribbon for that and a 1tb ssd $115. Add bonus type c connector, HDMI output and 2 more usb connections on a 200 lap.

Also Im attaching an image of its cover off so people have an idea of what your getting into', 'I bought the laptop for my 18 year old college freshman son. I am a software engineer, so basic things I look for in any computer is memory and storage, as well as how easy it is to increase these components. This laptop has tons of hard drive space for it pricing point, more than any other I saw in it’s price range, and although it only come with Only 4 GB of RAM, it can easily be upgraded to 16GB. Furthermore, it enables my son to do whatever he needs to do regarding basic computing tasks. Thus, this computer is a good entry level computer, for anybody needing to do only basic computer tasks.', 'I purchased this HP laptop for working on school assignments (papers, online research, etc), It has enough processor power and hard drive space to do all my work.

I needed one ungently to use with some softwares (Extron Global Configurator Pro and Nexia Audio Processor) for a new Audio and Video control over IP that work only on Windows. Two weeks ago this laptop was on sale for $499 so after looking at the specifications it was no brainer and got it from my local Best Buy. It took me a bit to get used again to Windows but in just a couple of hours I was working with my Extron software and completed the whole project in just three days.

This computer serves its purpose for work related matters.  I bought this at the early Black Friday deals when it was practically $300 off from the regular price. It was worth getting  for all its features. I\'m happy with this purchase!', 'I bought the laptop for my wife and she has not stopped thanking me since. The laptop works seamlessly and easy to setup too. She loves it and uses it almost everyday, I tried to have a feel of it too and I was blown away by its performance. Great product for its price.', 'Got this for a deal on Black Friday. It’s fast, lightweight, and sleek looking.\n\n The only reason I gave 4 stars is because like other people said, the fan can be loud sometimes. I think it’s a hardware issue cause updating or changing settings doesn’t help. It’s strange cause I have an older HP Pavilion x360 from years ago that has a hard drive and it’s quieter than this. At it’s highest the fan almost makes a whistling sound. Fortunately it’s not constantly on and I’m willing to ignore it since I don’t have to use this in a public space.', ""The keyboard is very nice for a laptop keyboard. I really like the trackpad as well, and of course you can use it as a tablet if you so desire. It is one of the easiest laptops I've ever typed on to be honest. I got it for 500$, so It would be quite a challenge to find a better laptop for that price. It boots up very fast with the ssd it comes with, has a fingerprint sensor to log in quickly, and the screen looks really nice. The ssd is a little small, but you can get an external Hard Drive to transfer the important backup files, pictures, etc. , which you should backup everything important with an external HD anyway, so no marks off for that. Overall with the intel optane and snappy SSD I think this computer would be very satisfactory for anyone in need of basic computer functionality. I don't game, but I doubt this would be a good choice for those of you who plan on gaming. There is no dedicated GPU and the benchmark scores are not very good for the integrated GPU in this laptop."", 'I purchased this laptop as an emergency replacement for an HP Envy 13t on which the solid state drive died after a year and a half.  Due to personal circumstances at the time, Macs or Chromebooks were not options, a properly kitted iPad was more expensive, and I needed something in stock at my local Best Buy store.  Hence this model.  This laptop is thicker, heavier and not as powerful as the deceased Envy 13t, but it is certainly adequate.  Set up took two hours and forty five minutes, which I consider to be excellent.  Among the best parts of set up were that once I signed in with my Microsoft account, it recognized I had an Office 365 subscription and that was activated on the pre-installed apps.  HP was pushing a Dropbox promo, which is the cloud service I use, so accessing my Dropbox files was easy as well.  The most challenging aspect of set up was that 45 (!) preinstalled apps needed Windows Store updates, which bottlenecked me trying to install a few additional apps from the Store.  Adobe Acrobat Reader would not install on the first two tries, but several days later installed successfully.  Much of the set up time was devoted to Windows updates and updates to the HP Assistant software (the process to update HP Assistant upon initial set up is not intuitive).  In daily usage, the laptop fan occasionally kicks in, but only on heavy duty (such as initial set up) is the fan noisy.  The backlit keyboard is the most frustrating part of daily usage, in that depending on the ambient light, the keys are hard to see either lit or unlit, and a slight change in angle relative to nearby light can make a huge difference in visibility or lack thereof (I have the silver keyboard model).  The trackpad is, as is typical of HP laptops, frustrating as well - I typically use a mouse as a result (or the touchscreen).  The laptop boots up and powers down quickly.  My anti-virus app and Malwarebytes run nearly as fast as on the Envy 13t.  Setting up bluetooth devices and printers has been very easy.  I have deliberately thus far kept my music library off the device (and have not loaded iTunes) so have not been able to test the speakers.  I have also not used the ""2-in-1"" features.  For over six years I once had a Dell XPS 12 2-in-1, and as a tablet, a laptop is a heavy tablet!  Overall, I was extremely pleased with the ease of the initial set up process.  I am satisfied with the daily usage with the keyboard lighting / visibility of the letters on the keys being the biggest negative.  This is certainly not the leader of the pack, but for the price it is very adequate, and for moderate daily use, very acceptable.', 'My daughter used Macbooks for 4 years in HS, then for her 1st year of college...  a few months ago her Macbook was acting up, so we went to get it replaced...  I convinced her to look at laptops, because there was nothing specific to MAC/Apple that she needed... She was hesitant at first, but is now telling me she loves her laptop...  so much more (notes, highlighting) she can do with the touchscreen.. and the laptop is 1/2 the price of the Macbook', '')"

Think DOS games, and early Windows 98/XP games -- stuff that ran back when computers had megabytes of ram instead of gigabytes, and megahertz CPUs instead of gigahertz CPUs.  And for that it works great.  Yea 80s and 90s games.  :)\n\nIt also is capable of web surfing, playing music/youtube, reading email, and light computer tasks.  Don\'t expect to play modern games or video edit on the thing, but if all you want is a capable small PC for casual use (or ancient gaming), it will do that, and provide a pretty decent overall user experience.\n\nThe trackpad is a bit sticky at first (it breaks in with use), and the keyboard is slightly cramped by the small 11.6"" form factor (but is actually a pretty decent typing experience considering that).  The display is ""OK"" -- it\'s not the brightest, and it\'s only 1366x768, but it is IPS and a touch screen, and the low resolution is less unacceptable on a 11.6"" panel anyway.  It\'s not the best kit out there, but it also doesn\'t cost $2000.  I think HP did a pretty good job of navigating a price to benefit ratio here.  There are tradeoffs, both in terms of added cost of bare minimum, and in terms of sacrificed features for cost savings, and HP seems to have balanced that pretty well.\n\nI got this when it was on sale for $120 off, so for the price I paid it was a GREAT value.  It\'s not quite the ""awesome sauce"" value at the normal price of $400, but I\'d still say it actually is a step above the stuff that generally sells for less, and probably still a good bang for the buck option even at full price.\n\nQuality: 3/5 -- It\'s a sub $500 laptop.  So it\'s plastic, and corners are cut.  But as plastic corners cut laptops go, it feels like it\'s ""acceptably"" constructed.\n\nValue: 4/5 -- At the sale price, this was a 5/5.  At regular price you are paying a bit more than the basement level, but you get a acceptably constructed laptop, a quad core pentium, 128GB of SSD storage.  It\'s a little RAM light by modern standards, but 4GB is not bare minimum either.  In short it\'s a good value at base price and a great value on sale.\n\nEase of Use: 4/5 -- Windows 10 has its quirks, but if you know how to use a PC, there\'s nothing especially difficult to using this one.', ""It's true with computers, to only purchase a computer for the needs you will have for it.

But the Optane is configured as the primary boot drive and has Windows, users, temp files and applications.  When I unboxed it and got through the initial set up, I immediately got a notification that the C drive was critically low on space.  There was no room left to install applications (I have lots).  Windows updates or even temp files from web browsing would have quickly used up what little was left.\n\nAssuming that I had made a mistake with the initial set up, I called HP tech support and was told that 1) Yes, this the way it's supposed to be and 2) They do not support another configuration, but I could pay them $49.99 to help me change it.\n\nFlabbergasted, I decided to do it myself.  So I did an image copy of the primary (Optane) to the SSD and changed the BIOS settings to boot the SSD.

I may eventually try to figure out a way to use the (now useless) Optane, but it's not a priority.\n\nWith the i7, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB ram and the suggested retail price of over $900 this is not a Chromebook and the configuration should have been better thought out.

Thankfully for fans of Windows the competition keeps getting better. The HP Spectre X360 is the latest generation of HP’s high-end convertible laptops Ultrabooks. Previous generations received good reviews but were marred by flimsy chassis and dim screen.\r\n\r\nDesign\r\nThe 2018 version of the Spectre X360 feels very sturdy with little flex. The screen takes a good amount of force to distort. The decorative grill at the base of the screen feels very sturdy and doesn’t flex like as it would in previous generations. The edge is chamfered on the top and bottom with a cooper finish that HP likens to a gem. It gives more a sense of thinness and does have an attractive look. Long term durability from drops might be a concern with the force concentrated to a smaller edge but of course dropping a laptop often ends in damage. The back corners of the base have a 45-degree angle allowing access to the power button on one side, regardless of mode, and a USB-C charging port which is also accessible regardless of mode. The finish is called dark ash which is a fancy word for dark brown. The copper and dark brown colors compliment each other well although it lends itself to showing every fingerprint. A fingerprint scanner is at the bottom right of the keyboard and a Windows Hello camera is above the screen. For those concerned with privacy there is a hardware switch on the right edge of the base to disable the webcam\r\n\r\nPorts\r\nThe left side has a single USB-A port. On the right is angled USB-C/Thunderport port intended for charging, an additional USB-C/Thunderbolt port, headphone jack, and microSD slot. Angling the charging USB port is a nice touch for those who are right handed using a mouse as it helps keep down the clutter. However; with every other port on the right side it might get a big cluttered if you are using a mouse on the right side too.\r\n\r\nDisplay\r\nThe display is a 13” full HD display which one source reports as 650nits. Without a way to measure it is hard to say but the display can get very bright. There should be no problems seeing the screen even in brightly lit rooms and possible some outdoor use. Glare is present as the screen isn’t anti-glare but overall it is manageable and allows more contrast. Off angle viewing is very good with minimal color shift for the class but glare does become much more evident. The FHD display is good for a more affordable price, battery life, and laptop use. If you have good eyes and are using it in tablet mode close up the pixels are detectable and text is less sharp but overall clarity is still acceptable. If there was any criticism of the display it would be the hinge and the huge bezels. It is very easy to open but the loose hinge can mean that the screen can change angle during use due to movements. It’s a tradeoff as you wouldn’t want to make it hard to open but you may find yourself periodically readjusting it. As for the bezels, it’s hard to say HP’s motivation on this but the bottom bezel is a massive 1” and the top is a solid 3/4”. It’s not a deal breaker but just feels excessive in 2018.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\nThis laptop is surprisingly fast between the Core i7 and the, assumed, NVME SSD. CrystalDiskMark clocked in read speeds over 3000MBps and write speeds nearing 1600MBps. At no point did the laptop ever feel sluggish. In fact, it is very surprising how quickly it responds to most requests. Even during heavy usage, the fan rarely kicks on and is nearly silent. Heat is manageable, and the fan settings can be adjusted further if needed in the HP Command Center. Opening Word seems nearly instantaneous and using the integrated Windows Hello Webcam logs in so fast it might make you question if your computer was locked. The integrated fingerprint scanner is slower but that seems more to do with the sensor than the speed of the system.\r\n\r\nBattery life\r\nIn the default settings in HP Command Center the system tries to dynamically figure out what performance works best for your needs. On this setting, it leans heavily towards performance, leading to about 7-8 hours of usage. If you change the settings to more battery efficient the system still feels very snappy during standard office use with the processor throttled down and fan usage is avoided at all costs. In this setting, the battery lasted much longer. On this mode it consumed approximately 1% every 10 minutes which could potentially mean battery life in the 15-16 hour range. Battery tests are highly subjective overall but unless you are a heavy power user this system should last you through a workday without a problem. Even if you do need a charge, the USB-C based charge means you can use a phone charger to top off. This is probably part of the reason the included carrying sleeve has no place for a charger.\r\n\r\nKeyboard and Trackpad\r\nFor the size of the laptop, the keyboard is quite spacious and doesn’t feel like a sacrifice. Key travel is very good and ends with a soft, distinct thump at the bottom. No hint of lag could be detected as even fast typing faithfully caught each keystroke. The movement feels more like a scissor key than a chicklet style. The keyboard is backlit with options for off, low, and high brightness. Key contrast is good with the white letters on the dark background and the backlight distinctly shines through the letters to light them up instead of just around the keys like some. The trackpad is a little less refined. It is very large as most newer laptops favor this design and is usually good. The movement is less natural than some other high end Windows laptops and periodically decides to act as if click lock is turned on causing you to drag items across the screen unintentionally. It seems HP has the sensitivity too high where it detects your finger above the trackpad when not actually on it. Hopefully HP will refine the sensitivity soon as the use is otherwise very good. This seems more of a need for a drive update as the system also stopped responding to gestures requiring a restart to fix. Thankfully restarts only take a few seconds so it is only a minor hassle.\r\n\r\nWebcam\r\nThe webcam is thankfully at the top of the screen so no Skype sessions filming your nose. It works extremely fast for logging in with Windows Hello but, unsurprisingly isn’t intended for taking photos. Skype video is a bit dark and blurry unless you are in a very bright room close to the screen. It’s perfectly acceptable for its intended use. On one occasion Windows Hello stopped working until a quick restart so it seems some more driver refinement is still needed.\r\n\r\nSpeakers\r\nThe speakers are surprisingly loud. You can easily play music or dialog and hear it across the room. In fact, music at full volume close is uncomfortably loud. The speaker range is lacking in bass as are most thin devices in the category. At full volume the speakers begin to distort with highs becoming uncomfortable harsh. Fortunately, in most cases turning it up to max volume is unnecessary. At lower volumes the range is very respectable for such a device.\r\n\r\nSoftware\r\nHP has never known for being lean on the software front adding lots of bloat to their system. In this case the only third part application, outside the ones that come on every Windows 10 system, is McAfee trial. The rest of the included software are HP utilities. The number of utilities seems excessive and complicated but, in most cases, you will rarely need to access them. That said, some refinement and simplification of the myriad of included HP utilities could really improve the overall experience.\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts\r\nAlthough tablet usage is a bit awkward with a keyboard on the back, thickness for a tablet, and large bezels the overall package still feels very high quality. There are certainly design compromises, but it seems HP understands most people use it as a laptop first and the least number of compromises are in that mode. Disregarding the convertible capabilities this is one compelling laptop. The extra modes are just a bonus. Some 13” laptops feel small in use, but HP has done a nice job making a small laptop feel large in use. If you are in the market for a Windows Ultrabook, the Spectre X360 2018 edition should be on your short list.', ""======= Summary =======\r\n\r\nThe HP Spectre x360 - with its fantastic design, build quality, ergonomics, bright display, performance, and long battery life - is an All-Around Winner~! This is the BEST laptop I’ve ever used. HP FTW~!!\r\n_______\r\nPro's:\r\n\r\n1. Bright, crisp, & responsive 1080P touch-screen (1-Watt, 400-nits).\r\n2. Relatively light (~2.9 lbs) and thin (~14mm) for a 360-degrees convertible laptop.\r\n3. Tent and Tablet modes are useful and nice to have.\r\n4. Pen support.\r\n5. Excellent keyboard and touchpad.\r\n6. Great design & excellent build materials and quality.\r\n7. Good selection of ports - both USB Type C & USB Type A. No need for dongles~!\r\n8. Excellent performance from the Intel Core i7, SSD drive, and 8GB of RAM.\r\n9. SSD is upgradeable (NVME M.2).\r\n10. Fantastic battery life.\r\n11. Great cooling design = quiet operation. \r\n________\r\nNeutral:\r\n\r\n1. Fingerprint magnet on this dark surface material. \r\n________\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1. No Microsoft Precision Touchpad driver. But there is a workaround...\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Design & Build Quality ====\r\n\r\nThe HP Spectre x360’s new Gem-Cut design language is sleek, modern-looking, unique, and very pleasing to my eyes. It reeks premiumness and feels great in the hands as well. It feels dense, high-quality, and solid as a tank. Love it~!!\r\nHP did an ingenious job by placing the power button on the top-left corner of the laptop base and the charging port on the top-right corner. Not only is this an excellent use of space, it is also very practical by avoiding clutter with other accessories and preventing accidental power-on and power-off. Brilliant~!\r\n\r\nOther thoughtful & smart design decisions include the user-facing speakers located right above the keyboard area as well as the fingerprint scanner located right below the arrow keys. \r\n\r\nAs a result of its placement, any music and videos you watch and hear will sound louder, more detailed, and fuller. \r\n\r\nThe fingerprint scanner worked very well and I was easily & quickly able to log-in to my Windows account. \r\n\r\nThe touchscreen worked accurately and in a very responsive fashion allowing the switch to Tent or Tablet Mode to be seamless and frustration-free.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can complain about, and it is a small First-World complaint, is its tendency to easily show fingerprint smudges and marks. With that said, I have owned several darker laptops before in the past and I’m used to cleaning it up frequently. \r\n\r\n10 out of 10~!\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Display ====\r\n\r\nThe special Intel-developed 1-Watt 1080P display, which can still get as bright as 400 nits, is crisp, has great color accuracy and contrast, and is a pleasure to stare at. For peace of mind, it is good to know that HP is using the protective and durable Corning Gorilla Glass on it.\r\n\r\nTouch functionality worked flawlessly as did writing with the HP pen.\r\n \r\n10 out of 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Speakers ====\r\n\r\nThe sound on this thin & light ultrabook from its quad-speaker configuration is great. Bass, of course, is weak but that is normal for a thin ultrabook. The intelligent placement of the speakers above the keyboard area results in sound that is direct-facing, loud, crisp, and more fuller-sounding compared to laptops that have their speakers underneath.\r\n\r\n10 out of 10~!\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Network & Connectivity Options ====\r\n\r\nThe excellent Intel Wireless-AC 9560 802.11AC Gigabit Wifi is inside the Spectre x360 and it performed very well in my home network. Also included in the Intel package is Bluetooth 5.0 which is forward-looking and up-to-date. I experienced no connectivity or connection speed issues. Everything was peachy. \r\n\r\n10 out of 10~! \r\n\r\n\r\n==== Ports ====\r\n\r\nI absolutely LOVE not having to use a dongle on the x360 to plug in my USB flash drives~! My older HP Spectre 13 laptop from 2017 had no USB Type A ports and it has been a frustrating and annoying affair on a consistent basis. That’s why I chose the x360 this time around for its better port selection. \r\n\r\nWith one USB Type A port, two USB Type C Thunderbolt ports (40Gbps), a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader, I’m set and satisfied.\r\n\r\n10 out of 10~!\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Performance ====\r\n\r\nWith an 8th-Gen Intel Core i7 Whiskey Lake quad-core CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and a Western Digital SN720 NVME SSD, the x360 performed fantastically at everything I demanded of it - Chrome browsing with >25 tabs, photo & video editing with Cyberlink PowerDirector, and general multi-tasking.\r\n\r\nOn Geekbench 4.3.3, the x360 scored 4775 Single-core and 12,789 Multi-core. \r\n\r\nOn CrystalDiskMark 6.0.2, I got 3023.4 MB/s Sequential Read and 1615.8 MB/s Sequential Write. \r\n\r\nI only wish the storage size was bigger, like 512GB. I’m planning on upgrading to the new Samsung 970 Evo Plus 1TB NVME SSD in the near future.\r\n\r\n10 out of 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Keyboard & TouchPad ====\r\n\r\nTyping on the keyboard is a delightful and supremely pleasant experience. HP, very wisely, is NOT following the design decisions of Apple Macbooks & certain Dell XPS line of laptops and is instead using a very comfortable, responsive, and tactile keyboard mechanism with great key travel. As a result, the keys have good spring, great damping, and are very quiet in operation. I absolutely adore this keyboard.\r\n\r\nThe same cannot be said, however, of the touchpad. HP, for some reason unknown to me, is STILL not using the excellent Microsoft Precision Touchpad drivers. Instead, HP is using Synaptics drivers which is vastly inferior in functionality and custom gesture support. So I did what I did with my older 2017 HP Spectre 13 laptop. After uninstalling the Synaptic touchpad driver from Device Manager, I manually installed the Microsoft Precision Touchpad driver from the Lenovo website. The specific driver version I used was 19.3.4.111 and it is for the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen6 laptop model. If you Google it, you should still be able to find that older driver.\r\n\r\nTo prevent Windows Update from automatically updating the Lenovo Precision driver to the newest non-Precision HP Synaptics driver, I used the Microsoft “wushowhide.diagcab” utility to hide the Synaptics driver update.\r\n\r\nWith the Precision Driver installed, I was back to creating my own custom three- and four-finger gestures and getting tremendous pleasure using the touchpad. \r\n\r\nHP seriously needs to terminate whatever agreement they have with Synaptics and start installing Microsoft Precision drivers in their Spectre laptop lines ASAP.\r\n\r\n9 out of 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Battery Life ====\r\n\r\nThis is the best battery life I’ve ever experienced from any laptop I’ve owned & used throughout the years. I didn’t achieve the crazy 22-hour battery life that HP is marketing but got about 8 hours out of it with brightness set to 100%. Fantastic...Simply fantastic.\r\n\r\n10 out of 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Software ====\r\n\r\nThe Spectre x360 came loaded with Windows 10 1803 which I promptly upgraded to 1809. There was the usual assortment of bloatware from both Microsoft and its third-party partners. I counted 10 third-party apps, 17 HP apps, and some Microsoft apps such as Xbox and Skype. Removing them, as is usual for Windows 10, is easy to do from Settings.\r\n\r\nI found some of HP’s apps to be genuinely useful such as the HP Support Assistant (firmware & driver updates), HP Audio Control (speaker sound effects & equalizer), and HP Command Center (setting laptop thermal profiles). \r\n\r\n10 out of 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Upgradeability ====\r\n\r\nThe Spectre x360, being a thin & light ultrabook, doesn’t offer meaningful upgrade options except for the NVME SSD drive. So one needs to be thoughtful about their current and future computing needs and select the components wisely. With my particular model, I feel confidently fine with the Core i7 CPU with 8GB of RAM. I just need bigger storage down the line (at least 1TB SSD). \r\n\r\n9 out of 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== My Verdict ====\r\n\r\nThe HP Spectre x360 with its Gem-Cut design is an excellent laptop that gets almost everything right. Fantastic build materials and quality, great-looking design, slim & lightweight form-factor, superb keyboard, excellent touchscreen display with pen support, flexible viewing options (e.g., Tent Mode), and all-day battery life. The only subpar area is the lack of the Microsoft Precision Touchpad driver which, fortunately, can be “fixed” by installing the Lenovo Precision Touchpad driver. \r\n\r\nAll in all, HP has crafted a fantastic and unique laptop that I thoroughly enjoy using. It is a very delightful machine."", 'The Spectre x360 is almost as premium as it looks. It’s got a fantastic look and build, specs that are just right, and it runs for hours. The amount of bloat that comes preinstalled is a little appalling, but otherwise this is an excellent laptop.\r\n\r\nI think the design of this laptop is going to be a bit polarizing. I’m personally a big fan of the dark gray color with the copper accents. The angles on the sides are a bit odd, but I do like them. It feels like the designers tried really hard to give the Spectre a ‘premium’ look and people who prefer a more understated look may find it a bit gawdy, but I think it looks great. The one thing I didn’t like so much was size of the bezels around the screen; it feels like there’s a lot of extra space that’s could be used by a screen with a slightly taller aspect ratio – maybe 16:10 instead of 16:9. The build feels very solid; nothing creaks or flexes, the hinges are solid, and I don’t feel any gaps running my fingers around it.\r\n\r\nThe specs feel just right to me. With a quad-core i7-8565U, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, and 802.11ac with Bluetooth 5. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like any of the internals are upgradeable, so that’s something to consider before going with this configuration. The screen is 1080p and it looks good; I do wish it was a little bit higher, but it’s plenty sharp on the 13” screen. There’s a good mix of ports too with 2 USB-C and 1 USB-A port (no dongle required!).\r\n\r\nI’ve been happy with the performance so far. My previous laptop had a dual-core Y-series i7 and I definitely notice the difference with the quad-core U-series. Everything loads quickly and transitions and animations are smooth throughout. Battery life is also excellent; HP quotes 22.5 hours of ‘mixed usage’ and I’m getting more like 14-16 hours, but it’s the best I’ve ever experienced and I can confidently say that I could take this out for the day without my charger.\r\n\r\nThe backlit keyboard is good; the keys have decent travel and good spacing between them. The trackpad is also good; it’s pretty big and it supports all of the Windows 10 gestures, but it feels like there’s the slightest input delay that I can’t help but notice and haven’t been able to correct in the settings. There’s also a stylus included. I don’t see myself using the stylus that much, but it does work well, probably about as well as the Surface Pen.\r\n\r\nThe webcam on top of the screen is good, but not great. The image is pretty soft in all but best lighting. It does support Windows Hello for login though, which is super-fast. HP also added a hardware switch for the camera on the side, so those concerned about privacy won’t have to tape over it. If you’re not using Windows Hello to login there’s also a fingerprint scanner next to the keyboard that works well too.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t very happy with the amount of bloat that came preloaded on the Spectre. At least a third of the tiles pinned to the start menu was just a bunch of extra crap – games, Dropbox, McAfee, some frivolous HP apps. Some of it might actually be useful to some, but most of it just feels insulting; something in this class of PC shouldn’t have all this advertising clogging up the UI. It’s easy enough to remove, but it shouldn’t have been there in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe tablet mode works well enough, but Windows 10 and what I use it for just doesn’t work as well with just a touch screen. The Spectre x360 is technically a 2-in-1, but if I’ve got the option I’ll usually use the keyboard and trackpad before the touchscreen. That’s either a testament to how great the mouse and keyboard experience is or how unrefined the touch experience is (or a little bit of both).\r\n\r\nOverall I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a great all-around Windows laptop, especially if you can appreciate the design and battery life. My only real issue with it is the bloatware, but fortunately that’s an issue that can be fixed.', 'The latest model of the Spectre x360 feels very polished overall. I was very impressed during my review with very few bad things to say. Lets explore.\r\n\r\nUnboxing:\r\nThis is a treat. The outer box is simple brown packaging but the actual Spectre packaging is inside. That box is two tone and high quality. Upon opening everything feels very premium and well thought out. You will find documents, the laptop, a carrying case, the stylus (with battery) and the 65 watt adapter. The adapter is great as much of the cable is wrapped in fabric and feels durable. It charges via USB-C. \r\n\r\nSet up: \r\nPretty standard Windows 10 setup here. The only changes worth noting are you will set up Windows Hello via facial recognition or via fingerprint initially. You can use both with further configuration after the initial setup.\r\n\r\nUse: \r\nTyping this review on the laptop, I am overall happy. The keys feels just right to type on but are a little offset to the left since the home, pg up, pg down and end keys are on the far right side. It takes some getting used to but is not a huge deal. The track-pad is wonderful. It feels high quality and is very precise. The touch screen is bright and responsive to touch. The screen is easy to move in different positions which is a pro or a con depending on how you look at it since it opens easily but will push back easily if you try to touch it in laptop mode.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\nIt looks amazing. The ash silver model looks more brown and gold to me than ash silver. The gem cut is actually very practical and not just a pretty design. The power button is on the left corner which keeps you from accidentally pressing it. The right corner has a second USB C connector which keeps the charger out of the way. The screen is bezeless on the sides but has a large chin and forehead. My main problem with use is when it is in tablet mode. It is kind of hard to use as a tablet since the new gem cut design creates lots of rough edges. This makes it somewhat uncomfortable to hold in your hands as a tablet. Therefore, it is somewhat difficult to take notes on. The fingerprint reader is a nice touch but it sometimes takes a few tries. I seem to have better luck unlocking with the face recognition. Weight is not too heavy and can be help for long periods.\r\n\r\nDisplay: \r\nThe color reproduction feels good enough and I tried to edit some photos on it with no issue. The blacks are a little bright which affects the overall contrast. It is a 1080p display but this is more than adequate for a 13 inch laptop. I couldn’t find what % of sRGB it supports but colors seem vibrant enough for me. The display is bright and crisp.\r\n\r\nBattery:\r\nHP claims there should be close to 22 hours of batter life. I don’t see that at all. I am getting more like eight hours or so (not timed, estimate) but that is way more than enough for me. It will easily last all day\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\nI was a little concerned with having 8gb of RAM vs 16 gb but in practical use, this is one zippy laptop! The 8th gen Core i7 is plenty fast for most of my needs including photo editing. It only has a Intel 620 GPU so simple gaming is ok but I wouldn’t push it too hard. The SSD is extremely fast and I attached a screenshot of Crystaldiskmark and Geekbench to show performance. For the average user, this computer is more than fast enough, for a power user it should meet most of your needs.\r\n\r\nAudio: \r\nThe speakers are great on this baby. This is the first convertible laptop I have had where you get great sound in both laptop mode and in tablet mode. The speakers fire on both sides of the keyboard section so no matter the orientation it will sound great. As for headphones, the output is clean and static free but it only supports 24bit 48000hz. For most people this is no issue but for some who listen to high res audio it might be a bit lacking. \r\nConnectivity: \r\n\r\nYou will find a good number of ports here. There is a USB A 3.1 port of the left side, the right side has two thunderbolt USB C ports. Either can be used for charging. There is also a micro SD card slot. I tossed a 256 gb card in there for music storage and it works great. It is a cheap and easy way to effectively double your hard drive space. There is a 3.5mm headphone jack and a switch to turn off the web cam as well. Bluetooth 5 is present and works well as well as a Intel 9560 WiFi chip which works great via AC networks. \r\n\r\nIn summary, this laptop is a head turner. It looks amazing, especially if you like gold. The laptop meets 90% of my needs and I am very happy with it. My only changes I would fix if able are better keyboard placement, higher res audio output, and a little more curve on the edges for tablet mode. These are minor gripes and this is a solid laptop.', 'This is the best looking laptop I\'ve ever used. The box itself just looks sharp and expensive. The laptop itself is sleek and impressively small. At 2.6 lbs it\'s the lightest laptop I\'ve ever used (though I\'m sure there are lighter out there) even if it\'s not the smallest.\r\n\r\nThe laptop boots very fast, thanks to the 500gb SSD drive. For a laptop this feels like ample storage (depending on your usage, of course) and is fairly standard. It can always be upgraded to a larger SSD, at somewhat of a hassle, or you can simply use micro-SD cards! This is a great option and one I\'m not used to seeing on laptops.\r\n\r\nThe computer and screen are gorgeous. The display looks great at normal HD settings. After looking over forums I\'ve not tried to figure out how to get it to 4k as it appears there are some driver issues right now.\r\n\r\nThis is a super-fast, super-responsive computer. Programs open right away, and I\'ve experienced no ""hangs"" yet, even with multiple programs running. Out of curiousity I ran it through ""Novabench"" to see how it compares benchmark wise to other laptops. The majority of the computer is in the top 80-90% (memory, speed, cpu, etc). The only thing that really brought the score down was the lack of video card. The onboard processor is very limited--you\'ll probably want to look elsewhere for gaming. I\'ve seen other reviewers mention external video card set-ups. This computer has the profile to work great with an external set-up if that\'s your preference.\r\n\r\nThe inputs are terrific and more than what I\'m used to from a light, modern laptop--there is not an ethernet port or HDMI, but that\'s standard for lightweight laptops anymore. It does include a USB-3 connector, which is hardly standard anymore and very nice to see. So many things still use USB that this is still a very necessary connection so it\'s nice not to have to use an adapter. It also includes two USB-C connectors (one is used to charge the battery when needed). My only gripe so far about this computer is the awkward placement of the charging connection--it\'s kind of at an angle between the back and side. I\'m used to being able to charge from either the right or the left directly on the side. It causes the cord to stick out at a slightly strange angle. Not a big deal, but just a little odd.\r\n\r\nThe laptop ran warm at first, but this seemed to mostly be due to initial set-up and updating. After the first few light sessions I updated the BIOS as well as some HP and Windows updates and haven\'t noticed it get any warmer than any other laptop I\'ve used.\r\n\r\nThe fan also kicks on fairly often depending on usage, but it\'s negligible sound (and again, much softer than older laptops I\'ve used).\r\n\r\nI also liked that it has 5ghz connection capability. This is what I usually connect to, since that\'s frequently the less-used wifi connection anywhere I am. My internet speeds are great as long as there\'s even a semi-decent connection around.\r\n\r\nThe pen that comes with it is easy and fun to use. I use Windows ink and have really enjoyed it. The screen in tablet mode is very responsive, and the resolution makes detailed artwork possible (not that I\'ve done any to speak of yet--I\'ve just mostly experimented with detailed doodles to test what kind of art can be done). I\'m going to invest in a better art program and see how that goes, but with the screen resolution and processor speed I expect it will run as well as anything else.\r\n\r\nThere is no real ""bloatware"" installed, so that\'s another plus. I replaced the McAfee right away with Bitdefender and Malwarebytes (both of which I already had subscriptions for), but McAfee is a decent program so feel free to use it if you need anti-virus software (and honestly Windows does a pretty good job of that itself these days--couple it with another free program here and there and you shouldn\'t need much of anything).\r\n\r\nIf you\'re looking to replace a high-end work laptop (or drawing tablet) you can\'t go wrong with this one--just don\'t expect to do much gaming without further investments.', 'I\'m not a stranger to owning expensive high end laptops, but never had one focused for business and light entertainment. All my previous serious laptops have all be gaming ones so my opinions will be based on someone who\'s used to having power hog types of machines.\r\n\r\nThe screen is, although ""just"" 1080"", it\'s a high quality screen with excellent viewing angles. The colors seem pretty accurate, but I haven\'t taken time to measure it; most people won\'t care anyways. The brightness can go up to painfully bright but the lowest setting should have been set just a little lower. It\'s just a hair too bright in dark rooms.\r\n\r\nIntel\'s brand new i7-8565u powers this unit and even though it\'s a low power chip it powerful enough to do desktop work. Coupled with 8GB RAM and an M.2 256GB SSD make this one heck of speed demon. Transferring a file over wifi AC1300 I was able to sustain ~80MB/s transfer while within 10\' line-of-site to the router.\r\n\r\nI\'ve attached a few benchmark results - PC Mar and CrystalDisk Mark. PC Mark and Crystal shows the power the Spectre x360 brings to the table. The weakness is, of course, gaming. But this isn\'t what the Spectre was made for. Still it\'s nice knowing you can game a little with it on your down time. 3dmark score was 417 in Time Spy, 364 graphic, 2585 CPU. VR Mark (the 620 is min spec for Windows VR) was 681 with 14.85 fps on Orange Room test.\r\n\r\nThe Spectre x360 comes with a sleeve and a Pen. I haven\'t tested my drawing programs with the pen yet but the little I have done is probably the biggest disappointment of the Spectre. As good as the laptop is, the pen is just poor. If you have a heavy hand then you won\'t many problems with it, but you will have some missing strokes. Drawing fine lines is a big hit or miss. The included pen is no where near suitable for drawing. Doing the ""scribble from corner to corner"" test there were at least 3 breaks even when pressing with a heavier than normal amount of pressure. Good thing I purchased a third party Windows Ink pen ahead of time. Using the third party pen was night and day. Thin strokes were perfect and the scribble test passed with various pressures. In my opinion, toss the pen and buy another from a company that specializes in making drawing tablets.\r\n\r\nSo far battery life has been hours more than I\'d ever expect from a laptop - remember I\'m a gamer, my laptops die after 3hrs. Surfed the web for 30 min and I\'m still seeing 100%, an hour later and I\'m still over 90%. What kind of magic did they put in there? I put the battery profile one setting over battery saver for on battery use, but use full power when plugged in (all tests were full power). It\'s kinda weird having a laptop that I can draw on that can outlast my tablet I used for drawing AND more powerful.\r\n\r\nBeing 13.3 inches and made of aluminum makes for pretty easy 1 handed used for me. I fold in in half an slip on finger between the halves to clamp on and add stability. I\'ve used this grip with all my tablets and haven\'t dropped one yet. I have to get used to windows tablet mode. Although I\'m used to this kind of interface with tablets it\'s just weird using window like that. I\'m just used to seeing all those floating windows. Sure I could turn off tablet mode, but it\'s actually kinda neat. I need to spend a bit more time in it to see if I\'ll actually start liking or hating it.\r\n\r\nSo, I\'m in love. The HP Spectre x360 is the Windows tablet I\'ve been waiting for going on 5yrs. Sure it\'s a bit on the expensive side, but thunderbolt, newest i7 mobile processor, speedy m2 ssd, and excellent wifi chip... maaaan you\'d be crazy to look anywhere else. I\'ll have to test gaming a bit when I go to my Dad\'s house during some down time. I\'m sure I can play some early 2k games easily - even Crysis!', 'HP has really made a name for itself in the last few years for being a top of the line product when it comes to Windows Laptops. This HP Spectre x360 is no exception and really packs a punch!\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n- The design is beautiful! I really wasn\'t sure of the angular edges but it really grew on me. It has virtually no bezel on the sides of the screen and overall is really compact and thin. It feels really easy to carry around too.\r\n- The ports are minimal but great. In an increasingly USB-C world I like how they still included one USB 3.0 port as well as a headphone jack. Just provides for better backwards compatibility while everything catches up.\r\n- Set-Up was a breeze, it doesn\'t have too much bloatware but any that does come with it you can easily uninstall.\r\n- The HD screen looks incredible and really pops while watching videos, the added Dolby Atmos support on videos (including Netflix) is a nice addition as well. Also when comparing 13"" to 15"" I think the 13"" is very ideal for on the go and portability.\r\n- Typing on it is very smooth. The key\'s provide enough feedback to feel firm but are still low profile and comfortable. The Camera privacy switch is another well made addition. Also it has a fingerprint sensor for signing in and other features and it works quickly and effectively.\r\n- Finally, the pen provides great additional functionality in tablet mode. And if you aren\'t a big note taker, it can still come in hand for doing some designs or using as a stylus so you don\'t smudge the screen.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n- I can see the hinge of the laptop screen becoming a problem over time. It is very functional in laptop, tent, or tablet mode but I worry that over use could cause it to be flimsy as sometimes I notice the screen can womble when I carry or move it around in laptop mode. I know this is a difficult compromise to make for 2-in-1\'s as you don\'t want the hinge to be too tight or too loose. It\'s just something to consider with longevity but I could be wrong.\r\n- This is not a 4K screen model and that\'s okay, but I think at least HDR should be standard on new laptops as they are on most cell phones and tablets.\r\n- I wish the laptop had an easier way to carry the pen with it. Either magnets or some sort of storage or attachable component. It\'s just not as easily accessible as it should be.\r\n- There are no USB-C adapters that come in the box. It\'s just another purchase you will have to make if you want more ports or HDMI and ethernet access.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: HP\'s Latest Spectre x360 is another great achievement. It\'s fast, thin, and can do pretty much anything you need from a laptop. Immediately when you use this, it will be your go to do it all sidekick.', '')"

6345059 ,"('This is a beautiful classy looking laptop. The Spectre X360 packs lots nice features into a small thin computer. I bought this computer based on several positive online reviews\n\nThe pros: it is pretty to look at, so if you want to impress everyone, this will do it. The video is supper clear, which is one of the features this laptop excels at. The WIFI is good. The neat thing is the backlight keyboard for easy use at night. HP use all the latest technology unlike some other brands which seem to be a little behind.\n\nThe cons: This laptop tends to run hot under heavy workloads. The good thing is HP uses a power management which cause the fans to run as soon as it gets warms. Then they shutoff once cool. When not plugged in the battery life seems to drain faster if your using it under heavy loads. Speaking of battery one issue I have run into is Windows 10 saying the battery is plugged in but not charging. The fix is to unplug the power supply and do a hard reboot, then plug in. Since my computer is still new, not sure if this is related to the computer or more a windows problem. As for price value, it is a little more than some other brands, but based on the features you can see why. The weight of this Spectre 15.6 model is a little heavy if you want to carry it from one room to another compared to the 13 inch model. Another issue is because this is a touch screen the laptop tends to get full of finger prints easy. A nice soft cloth help keep it clean.\n\nThe bottom line, the reason I choose this is because it is not ugly looking and has lots of good basic features. If your looking for a laptop that can do simple stuff like surfing the internet, watching videos, or running Office related software, then this is a good choice. However, if your more into editing videos or playing lots of games, then this might not be the best. The reason I chose the 15.6 model over the similar 13 inch Spectre is because this computer uses a better graphics card and the latest OLED screen. Plus the screen is bigger to look at since my vision is not perfect. Also this laptop uses separate parts unlike the 13 inch model where everything is integrated in one main board. This means over time if something goes bad, I only need to have that part fixed instead of the whole computer like in the case of the 13 inch spectre. I hope this review helps.\n\nMy additional recommendations are to purchase a wireless mouse which will make life more easy than trying to use the track pad, Also buy a cheap laptop stand to help get the laptop off a flat desk for better cooling.', 'I am really enjoying this computer.

6301872 ,"('HP has made sure that the first impression of the Spectre Folio is one of exceptional quality. The packaging is first rate. The notebook is packed on top of the box with a black tissue paper wrapper, Upon pulling back the black paper, the high quality full grain leather wrapped around the notebook is revealed. It\'s soft and screams luxury. Upon lifting the notebook out of the box the smoothness of the leather is felt (mine was Cognac Brown); very nice. As you open the case you feel a nice balance between the top and the bottom of the notebook, both are about the same thickness and weight. On the right side are 2 USB C, thunderbolt 3 ports, on the left there is one USB C port. Any of the ports can be used to connect the USB C charger. HP claims the i7 version will get 15 hours on a charge and the i5 version will get 17 hours. During setup you are introduced to Microsoft\'s Hello, it\'s facial recognition technology that can be be used to login. It is similar to Apple\'s Face Id, except it also uses IR to iluminate the subject, so it can be used effectively in the dark. This was the first time I\'d used Hello and it worked extermely well, you see some flashing red led\'s and your logged on very quickly (after you\'ve registered your face).\r\n\r\nIncluded in the box is a USB C to USB A adapter, a HP Stylus (Tilt Pen which uses 1*AAA battery) with 4096 pressure levels and a 65W power adapter. When getting the notebook set up, one of the first things I noticed was the wonderful keyboard, given the thinness of the base, the keys still have a decent amount of travel and a great feel. The keyboard is very nicely backlit, with light around the key as well as some light thought the keys. The keys are nicely spread out with the feel of a nice full size keyboard (less the numeric pad). \r\n\r\nThe next think I noticed the georgous, bright screen (400 nits), I adjusted the screen up and down and did not see any color shift, even at very wide viewing angle. Now about the screen it\'s quite diferent from most laptops, instead of being hinged at the bottom of the screen it\'s hinged in the middle, allowing the bottom to rest infront of the keyboard or to be pulled out so the bottom rests covering the keyboard with the trackpad visible (Tent mode). This would certainly be useful for watching a video or for giving a presentation. If you pull the screen further, it slides down flat over the keyboard, making the the notebook into a 13"" tablet that\'s less than 1"" thick at the spine, and less than 1/2"" at the front. But it\'s very solid, there are magnets that guide and keep the screen in its normal, tented and flat positions. It takes a a little pull to release the screen from it\'s laptop position, but it\'s not an unreasonable tug.\r\n\r\nAfter having it up and running, you notice how quite, it is, no fans. But it has either a Intel i5-8200Y or i7-8500Y processor in it, these are Intel\'s latest, top of the line, low power processors they support turboboost up to 3.9Ghz or 4.2Ghz, but they only ramp up when necessary. This is suspose to greatly increase battery life. I did some testing, browsing, streaming video and watching video locally (at all times connected via wi-fi). All videos were very smooth (<10% CPU utilization), I ran for just over 10 hrs and the battery life had dropped to 20%, so I doubt it would have been 15 hours, but not that far off. Getting over 10 hours I consider impressive. Now this computer is suspose to have a fast charge function, and charge to 50% in under 30m. I did not see this speed in my initial testing (on any of the ports) - keep reading. \r\n\r\nThe next thing I went to do was edit some photos, I looked long and hard for a micro SD card slot,some HP specs said it existed, others did not; my unit did not have one. I was dispointed there was no microSD card card slot. So I attached a handy multifunction USB C device with a SD and microSD card reader (and multiple USB 3 ports + HDMI & LAN) and it was promptly recognised, and I could easily move photos to the notebook (guess I could have also gotten them from one of my cloud accounts, but since the camera was handy it was the first thing to come to mind). All the editing was smooth, I used the pencil (tilt) to mark up a photo, it worked well, allowing different thickness of lines based on the pressure on the stylus, It allowed me to outline objects with great accuracy; one function I really wanted to see/use. At first I was editing like a laptop, I then ""tented"" the screen, I found this much more easy to do and more accurate. Pretty happy about the pen\'s usefullness.\r\n\r\nNow having used the system for sometime (on a table) I reclined to my couch, and used it in my lap. I found a new use for it, a leg warmer (not a heater). The base of the unit does get warm, but not really hot; the leather feels nice warm. The leather really feels nice in you lap compared to the usual hard plastic or metal. I then streamed some music throught the onboard speakers.... kind of tinny; I then played with the audio controls and the sound was greatly improved, but still lacked any low end. I streamed to an external BT speaker and I was impressed, very impressed. So the B&O speakers did not impress me, they could get loud, but they did not sound great. The HP Audio Boost with them works pretty well, especially with better speakers. I was pleased with the enhancements for music and for video.\r\n\r\nI also connected a HD monitor to the USB C Multi-function adapter (mine not supplied) to insure the notebook could drive a second HD monitor, No problem! I then tried attaching a 4K monitor, it was promptly recognised and I extended my diplay to have the HP Folio notebook + a 4K monitor as a second display. Yea, it worked as I\'d hoped. I then connected a Ethenet cable and it was up and running on my LAN, again just I\'d expected. This is one of the big advantages of USB C and Thunderbolt 3, the ability to attach multiple high speed peripherials, this notebook has 2*Thunderbolt 3 ports + one USB 3.1 C port; really a lot of expansion functionalty.\r\n\r\nAfter some more testing I found there was a HP Bios update (throught the HP Update utility); after applying it I re-tested the fast charging and it now seemed to work, the BIOS update said it fixed a issues where the ""system incorrectly reports the status of the battery as fully charged"", that must have been it. Another note, I have the 256GB unit without WAN support; after the system is fully installed there is only 194GB available after cleaning up the system install/update files. So plan your purchase accordingly, this notebook cannot have it\'s memory or storage upgraded, what you purchase is is what you get. HP\'s web site says it will ship with SSDs of 256GB, 512GB, 1TB & 2TB. Given what the base price of this unit is, I\'d suggest starting with more than the 256GB SSD. Especially since you can\'t just insert a microSD card to update the storage available (this disapointed me the most about this machine - loose 1 star).\r\n\r\nBut it you choose wisely it\'s a beautiful notebook, which will surely get a second look wherever you take it. And whereever you take it it feels good in your hands, just over 3.2 lbs with possibly 15 hrs battery life, it is still a powerful notebook. Especially if your looking for something different or just want to show off a little, it is pretty (and nice).', 'HP has been on a roll and it has not been afraid to try new things to the market. This Spectre Folio is a perfect example of that. HP decided to partner with Intel to bring the product to the market.\r\n\r\nUpon opening the box you can tell immediately that this is a premium device. The box itself is of a minimalist design and I appreciated that. This leather clad 2 in 1 is just amazing and I really love this more than I thought I would. The leather is real and feels great in the hands and aesthetically speaking there is nothing else like it on the market which makes it the first of its kind. It is also a direct competitor to the Surface. \r\n\r\n:::Hardware:::\r\n\r\nThe hardware in this product is decent and under the hood you will find a Intel Core i7-8500Y processor it is dual core with 4 threads. It also includes the following; 8GB of ram, 256GB of fast SSD storage, 13.3 inch FHD 16:9 touch sreen with stylus support right out otf the box. You will also find 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, 1 USB Type-C 3.1 first gen port,\r\nand a 3.5mm audio jack.\r\n\r\n:::Functionality::\r\n\r\nNow there is no doubt that this is a sleek and attractive deivce. But that comes at a price. HP opted to go with a more energy efficient parts in the Folio 13. The i7 performs well but is only a dual core and is more on par with a i5 in terms of processing power. The I7 is no slouch but still I would have preferred a different version of the i7. The amount of ram could have been better in my opinion a low voltage DIMM would have been a better choice here. Most premium devices offer anywhere from 12-16GB of ram. Battery life is not what HP claims I have managed to get 8 hrs of battery life mixed usage. It takes about 2 & 1/2 hours for a full charge.\r\n\r\nThe screen is plenty bright for most users it is a tad shy of 300 nits of brightness. For those who opt for the LTE model using this in bright outdoor light is not practical. The 1080p screen has good RGB coverage, and good enough for my use. The screen is not detachable and I am just fine with that. It has three modes regular, flat and what I will call media mode. laying the screen flat works great when using the stylus. Media mode the screen sits a slant and the keyboard will be hidden. The stylus uses a AAAA battery and is active and has good accuracy and minimal lag input. I found it to be great when using One Note.\r\n\r\nSound quality is respectable with HP usual B&O branded speakers. The sound is rich and has decent bass for a small device. I a glad that this device has a 3.5mm jack.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is good and the keys feel good when typing. The keyboard lettering is bold and I appreciate that being that my vision is not the best. Most keyboards have small lettering on the keys.It is also backlit and that is a plus for a device like this. I was surprised this came with a stylus and it functions well. \r\n\r\nFor a device like this I expected HP to provide a leather care kit but they did not. Anyone who owns leather items know that you must maintain the leather to keep it clean & hydrated otherwise it will age poorly. I think some may be concerned about the quality of the leather I believe it should not be a concern as long as you care for and maintain the leather just like you would in your car.\r\n\r\n:::Pros:::\r\n\r\n- Sleek & professional design\r\n- Stylus included\r\n- Braided USB C charging brick\r\n- Good battery life\r\n\r\n:::Cons:::\r\n\r\n- Paltry amount of ram (8GB is too little)\r\n- A leather care kit was not included\r\n\r\n:::TL;DR:::\r\n\r\nThis is an attractive device that brings something new to the market. It will give its competitors a run for their money. Sure it is not perfect and despite a few flaws I still would recommend this device.', 'I wanted this laptop cause I love tech and especially unique tech. A laptop that is made out of genuine leather? Sign me up! \r\n\r\nThis is certainly a unique and welcome take on the popular 2-in-1 laptop that we see so much of today. When I took it out of the box I was shocked at how thin and light it really is. Using the leather as the body of the laptop results in one of the thinnest laptops I’ve ever seen, and there’s obviously never a need to outfit it with a case. Sit it on a desk and unless someone sees the HP logo on it they will just think it is an executive portfolio notebook. The leather is premium but I do wish it came in black though instead of brown (also comes in burgundy). It is built surprisingly well, look and feels like a laptop in a leather case so I do not doubt it’ll do well against daily bumps.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the Spectre Folio so unique is its three screen positions: laptop, media, and tablet. Laptop is exactly like it sounds, there is a hinge that allows you to open and close the screen just like any ordinary laptop. The second position is called media and you pop the lower half of the screen out and set it between the keyboard and trackpad. This is similar to the “tent position” on other 2-in-1s, where you can prop it up to watch movies or TV but this new way is much more elegant and practical. Finally, the tablet position is where the screen sits on top of the keyboard. The hinge used for laptop mode keeps the screen at a slight angle so it’s not completely flat-perfect for using the pen on the screen. When in tablet mode your hands will be against the leather bottom of the laptop. It feels much more natural than the awkwardness of a plastic keyboard like you would find on other 2-in-1 convertibles. There is one major downside to the tablet mode though which is you cannot wake up the device without positioning it out of tablet mode. All of the buttons including the power and touchpad are sitting under the screen and the screen does not support tap-to-wake. This is a big bummer to what otherwise would be a near flawless device.\r\n\r\nThe backlit keyboard itself is very good, plenty of travel considering the thinness of the device and there is a lot of space between the island-style keys. The trackpad is small but works fine. The touchscreen could be a bit more responsive. As expected on a device this thin, the B&O speakers are not going to blow you away but surprisingly they get very loud. I’m not much of an artist and my handwriting is horrible so I never take notes, but I do appreciate that it comes with the pen and an adhesive backed holder that can be attached to the leather body if needed.\r\n\r\nSpec wise you have a Core i7 dual core (4 threads) with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB M.2 storage. It’s certainly not the most powerful laptop you can buy but with a fanless design it also will never make noise. It won’t be the best choice for gaming or CPU intensive tasks like photo and video editing. However, it’s no slouch either. I have been using it as my daily Windows PC for over a week now and I have not had any issues with performance.\r\n\r\nHP’s battery life claim is an insane 21 hours of video playback. Obviously that is best case scenario and likely with the i5 CPU. I haven’t timed it but it is definitely more than I’m used to based on the fact that I’ve only put it on the charger twice and have used it at least 3-4 hours a day. And if that’s not enough it supports fast charging that’ll get you to 50% in about 30 minutes with the 65W charger that it comes with. I also love the fact that I just need to pack one USB-C charger with me to charge both my 2018 iPad Pro and Spectre Folio.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\nThree usable positions: laptop, media, and best of all, tablet.\r\n13” Full HD IPS 16:9 Touchscreen\r\nLeather folio design is ingenious and premium\r\nQuiet – Fanless Design\r\nEfficient Core i7 Dual Core\r\nIncredible Battery Life\r\nFast Charging\r\nUSB-C Charging\r\n2 Thunderbolt 3\r\nStill includes Headphone Jack\r\nIncludes pen\r\nWell designed keyboard\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nNo convenient way to wake screen in tablet mode\r\nTouchscreen could be more responsive\r\nBrown (wish it were black)\r\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an ultraportable convertible laptop. Especially if you’ve been disappointed by the 2-in-1 devices you find on the shelves today.', 'I\'d been looking for a laptop for a while now and was settling on the fact that not much is available as far as performance and versatility without spending thousands. Upon setting my eyes on this device, I was amazed at the novel way the screen folds in ways no other unit does. The leather added a nice touch and I thought it would help protect it. So when I received it in this obsidian black jewel box with magnetic closure, I was surprised as I\'ve never received a laptop with such flair. Typically they come shipped carefully wrapped in efficient packaging with minimal attention to detail. HP has added a new level of luxury to tech and it\'s quite refreshing!\r\n\r\nUnboxing was a treat: obsidian black jewel case with thin silver script ""SCEPTRE"" in the center opens to reveal tissue paper held closed with HP label wrapped around a black fiber satchel within which is the HP Sceptre in all its glory and with it, the luxury leather scent permeating the air. Yes people, this is real top grain leather in cognac brown not unlike that found in fine Italian sports cars.\r\n\r\nIt comes well accessorized too with pen, usb-c to usb-a adapter, and a cloth braided power cable to boot. Power it up and you have a crisp 1080p screen, full sized backlit keyboard, ultra premium B&O sound system, and face ID.\r\n\r\nSetup was quite easy and the onscreen assistant was courteous. Face ID works great with the IR sensors picking up facial contours It\'s very fast and responsive for only 8Gb of RAM, though I\'m sure the SSD has something to do with that. One thing that\'s missing is the fan, quiet just like a tablet. Having such a powerful processor like the i7 and no fan sound made me think this thing was going to start burning my legs at some point; slight warmth though I couldn\'t tell if it was my body heat transferring to the leather back. In laptop mode, the screen bends to about a 75 degree angle to which (at 6\'5"") was not uncomfortable. Movies and Youtube vids came in loud and clear when in theater mode with the now rear firing position of the speakers and surround sound is exceptional in any position. In tablet mode, I loved the way the screen completely hides any clue of a full keyboard rather than every other convertible unit folding it on the back. Pen input was precise and using the Paint program allowed me to familiarize myself with it though I didn\'t quite like the tapping sound tip to screen made. You don\'t fully understand the quality and unique abilities of this unit unless you fold the screen over in laptop mode and let it hang, then you truly see just how thin it is and how you\'ve found the perfect combination without compromising anything!\r\n\r\nI have only 2 cons: highly reflective display made viewing difficult in some situations and the keyboard skips characters after using the trackpad while writing this review to make corrections which is a bit disconcerting, but manageable.\r\n\r\nIf cognac brown leather and specs don\'t wow you enough, you\'ll want to wait a couple of months for a Bordeaux leather, 4k screen, up to 16gb ram, and possibly bigger SSD.\r\n\r\nHp always had their eye on a premium experience with the higher end units; I believe combining good specs with cutting edge design and premium materials has elevated this model to a luxury experience.', ""I have never really cared for 2-in-1 designs. I always felt that the tradeoff for the switch-ability between tablet and laptop always kneecapped one or both of the modes. Now I have had a few work computers that were 2-in-1s but I never used their tablet mode. The HP Spectre Folio is the absolute first where I've used both modes, and feel that both of them are an outstanding experience.\r\n\r\nFirst, let me start off by saying that you will be spending A LOT of time showing this thing off to people when they see it. The Folio makes a statement and people are digging this computer. I have had computers where people have said, 'Hey, that's a nice computer.' but this is the first where people have wanted to touch it and play around with its different configurations. If I were single, I would say that it would be almost effective as having a cute dog in starting conversations with women! If you are anti-social or an introvert, this may cause you some discomfort if you take it out in public.\r\n\r\nOk, with that out of the way, how is the Spectre Folio in use? It is an outstanding laptop and 2-in-1. I won't be playing any games on it so I really don't care that it only has a 2-core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM. I plan on using this mostly for writing and research and it has been a stellar experience doing both. Typing on this things is so nice because the keyboard is almost absolutely silent and it is so nice to have your palms resting on the leather instead of cold aluminum or plastic. The trackpad may be small but it is incredibly responsive and easy to use. In tablet mode, it covers the keyboard instead of just flipping the screen around and having the keyboard on the back. Yeah, I know that those other 2-in-1s deactivate the keyboard when you do this, but I always thought it looked silly and quite frankly, I didn't like the knocks that the keyboard deck would take when used that way. With the screen folded over, it makes it so nice to use the pen in landscape mode to sketch out ideas with the really great pen that HP gives you, but in portrait mode it REALLY shines. Scrolling through web pages is so great this way because you can see so much of the page in this tall mode and the way it is folded over makes one side thicker than the other so it is kind of like holding a folded back magazine and not just some big slab of computer. It is even great using while standing up and walking around because it is so easy to cradle in the crook of your arm and writing with your other hand on the screen. I've NEVER felt that that was a great way to use a computer but I've already done it twice and it just feels right.\r\n\r\nI won't probably ever be using it for watching videos, I've done that before and invariably the person in front of me will recline their seat and then I have the keyboard jabbing me in the gut in order to see the screen properly. This is the first computer where I might try again on my next flight. Its 'tented' mode puts the screen at a perfect viewing angle and leaves the trackpad available to control playback.\r\n\r\nLook, I can gush all over this thing for a ton more column inches but here is the bottom line: if you want a stylish computer that is as equally easy and nice to use in both tablet as well as laptop forms, just go get the Spectre Folio!\r\n\r\nI have only two things I would like HP to address in subsequent iterations of the Folio: \r\n\r\n1: Make it so the pen holder can go on either side. There is a slight indent on the back of the right side of the screen but not one on the left. Another way me and my left-handed people are spit upon.\r\n\r\n2 - HP FINALLY made a nice brick for a laptop (it is just like my favorite from Dell) but they insist on pairing it with a long outlet plug. Please add an attachment that can go onto the brick that adds the plug in a fold in/out configuration. I've added an aftermarket plug adapter to make it more compact but it doesn't have to be this way. The Folio is so stylish and slick, and they went about 3/4ths of the way with this power brick design but the actual plug could be better.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that neither of the two concerns/issues revolves around the leather. That is because I think this stuff is going to be virtually indestructible. I mean, I have had a ton of metal computers get scratched up and I expect this one to be no different but this auto-grade leather seems super tough to me and it might 'weather' to a really cool distressed look.\r\n\r\nIf you want an extremely nice computer that is quiet, functional, and stylish, I can't think of another 2-in-1 that fits that bill. I can't see anyone being disappointed in this computer. If you are seriously considering the HP Spectre Folio, just pull the trigger and get it, you have shown already that you have style and taste just by considering it. Show that you have the brains too by buying it!\r\n\r\n(BTW, in the pictures I forgot to put the USB-C to USB-A dongle in the photo, but HP does give you one.)"", 'This HP Spectre Folio Ultrabook has a unique design which includes a rare media viewing mode, in which the display tilts forward and covers the keyboard. The digital pen works best to draw on the display in media viewing mode, because the screen has no wobble at all in the media viewing mode, this is as a result of the display being held in place with a series of magnets when it is in media viewing mode. \r\n\r\nThe best thing about this HP Spectre Folio, is that this computer does not have an internal fan. This HP computer has a mobile version of the Intel i7 processor, which allows it to function while using less power, and the mobile type of processor is why it is able to be fan less without overheating. Fans inside computers do build up dust over time, which needs to be cleaned periodically to prevent the fans from being less effective at removing built up heat. It is really nice when a computer does not need an internal cooling fan, with that said, I point a fan at myself and this computer while using it, of which the airflow does blow away any built of heat from the HP Spectre Folio, but this is really only be necessary at times when I am using the computer in a hot room on a hot day.\r\n\r\nThe unboxing of this HP Spectre Folio was what is expected from a premium priced Ultrabook, it was packaged in a padded box within a box, of which the inside box is really nice. The HP Spectre Folio Ultrabook and accessories were cradled by form fitted plastic sections. This form fitted plastic packaging, has a better feel compared to cardboard materials for the inner packaging materials.\r\n\r\nThe 65-watt power adapter kit is quite nice, it has a braided cable on the USB-C cable side, and the power cord which plugs into the power adapter, is a premium round power cord.\r\n\r\nThis HP Spectre Folio has 3 USB-C type connectors, two of which are Thunderbolt compatible. Included is a USB-C extension dongle which allows plugging in standard USB devices. \r\n\r\nThe HP Spectre Folio Ultrabook is covered in a really nice quality of leather, and this leather encased Ultrabook, makes for a unique computing experience. I guess you could say this HP Spectre Folio might be less likely to be stolen, as it might appear as if it is nothing more than a leather folder containing paper.\r\n\r\nThe HP digital pen that is included is mostly made of aluminum, except the end shirt clip section is plastic. The plastic shirt clip allows this digital pen to be placed on a tabletop and it will not roll away and fall on the ground like other round-only digital pens have a tendency to do. The digital pen holder is not optimal in my opinion, as it is made of leather, and the digital pen already fits too snugly in the holder, making it slightly a hassle to fit the pen into the holder, and since leather shrinks, if it ever got wet, the pen holder would end up being an even tighter fit for the pen. A rubber molded style of pen holder, which is magnetically attached, would have been a better option, but choosing leather for the pen holder was an understandable choice, since leather is the theme of this Ultrabook. I chose not to attach the leather digital pen holder to the HP Spectre Folio, since I use it at home all the time, and I place the digital pen next to the Ultrabook, and that is good enough for me. The HP digital pen does have two buttons which can be programmed.\r\n\r\nThis HP Spectre Folio has 4 speakers which actually sound great, I am not sure if it is the tuning of the speakers that is done by Bang and Olufsen, or if the speakers themselves are actually Bang and Olufsen speakers, but they do sound about as good as small speakers are capable of sounding. I find it best at times when I want to hear louder music, to simply connect a Bluetooth speaker to the Ultrabook. Also, when connecting a Bluetooth speaker to the Ultrabook and playing the audio with the Bluetooth speaker, this uses less of the Ultrabook’s battery.\r\n\r\nWhen lifting the display, it is best to grab it with two hands by the front left and right corners while lifting, as there are two sets of magnets, which hold the lid securely to the lower keyboard section. The hinge for the display, has just the right amount of tension so as to make it perfectly easy to lift. The screen in laptop mode is secure enough to use the digital pen on, but it is common for touch screens to wobble a bit when using a digital pen, and so the digital pen does function much better when the HP Spectre Folio is in media viewing mode.\r\n\r\nI am rating this HP Spectre Folio at 4.2 out of 5 stars, as it is a really unique computing experience, and I would suggest this Ultrabook to anyone who can afford the premium pricing category that this computer is in.', 'The HP Spectre Folio is a sweet laptop 3-in-1 that looks, feels, smells and works like a premium laptop. \r\n\r\nIt is wrapped in 100% full grain leather, which gives it a great smell and feel; and makes it fingerprint free! The only places for fingerprints are on the screen and keyboard. Animal lovers probably will wish they had used synthetic leather rather than real leather however.\r\n\r\nUnlike other 3-in-1 laptops, when in tablet mode the Spectre Folio keyboard is completely covered by the screen. This is so much nicer than when the keyboard ends up on the bottom with the keys facing downward. It is a smartly engineered design. \r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed right away is how quiet this laptop is. I have yet to hear the fan working! The Bang & Olufsen speakers do a pretty good job of projecting a clean stereo sound when watching movies too. The screen is Full HD, not 4k, but on a screen this size it really doesn’t matter. Images still look amazing.\r\n\r\nA stylus is included and it has a home in a sleeve that can be attached to the side of the laptop. Again, a better solution than other laptops that have the stylus sleeve attaching via the usb port.\r\nSpeaking of usb ports, the Spectre has three Thunderbolt usb type c ports (one for the power cord). In case you have peripherals that haven’t adopted the usb type c format yet, one converter cord is provided in the box.\r\n\r\nAt almost 3.5 lbs., it is a little on the heavy side for its size, and compared with the Spectre from a couple years ago, it is thicker as well. Then again, the older model Spectre didn’t have a touchscreen or tablet mode like this one does.\r\n\r\nI am really digging this laptop. The cognac brown color resembles the color and feel of a football. Gaming aside, this laptop seems to have the power to handle anything pretty easily.', '')"

I have a semi-custom gaming laptop with high power fans on it - which I don\'t mind b/c if I\'m on it, I\'m wearing headphones so I don\'t hear it.  But the Folio was silent when running so great for meetings or classes.  Travel length on the keyboard is ok - laptopish, but again it\'s not my gaming rig with super clicky mechanical switches.  I does not have a 9 key number pad but I\'d rather sacrifice that for size than have tiny keys to fit that in on a 13.3"" format.  For an on the go, looking great, super quiet, subtle 2 in 1, I think this thing rocks and really fits the bill.  Also, being leather, It\'s not quite so obvious it\'s a laptop until you open it up.  Battery life over the couple of weeks I\'ve had it has been as advertised and I also bought the travel dock to expand it\'s functionality with my existing peripherals.  As for cons...I just wish I could have found one with the LTE option - that would have been amazeballs.', 'I am satisfied with this Spectre Folio Leather laptop.', 'Everything i expected from Hewlett Packard in a very sleek slim design.', 'Computer has a great look and feel.

I purchased this laptop for school, and I use some very processor heavy applications that my old laptop just wouldn't handle anymore. So I found this device while looking for desktop level power in a laptop.\r\n\r\nMy only qualification for this device was that there were a lot of discrepancies in the description for this device in particular. \r\n\r\nFirst off, there is not a legitimate product identifier. This product could have been a wide variety of HP Zbooks. To be clear for anyone else on the fence about this product, it is an HP Zbook G2. \r\n\r\nI will go ahead and list every item that my particular zbook came with for clarification to others. \r\n\r\nprocessor: Listed as Intel core i7-7700HQ or i7-4800MQ. mine came with Intel core i7-4900MQ. The main differences here is that the one it came with is 5 years old. It is more powerful overall, but used more battery too. The problem is, since they do not provide the model number (15-30543 doesn't point to anything relating to this computer online)\r\nRAM: Listed as 8Gb. Came with 8Gb.\r\nHDD: Listed as 750gb. Mine came with 1Tb. (a good thing)\r\ntotal USB ports: 4 mine came with 3. (also states they are USB3.0 AND also states it has USB 3.0 type C ports. mine doesn't come with USB type C)\r\nDoes come with a dedicated GPU, which is great. NVIDIA Quadro K2100M and integrated as well. \r\nOS: windows 10 home mine came with windows 10 pro. \r\n\r\nThe only problem I am finding with the device is that the track pad stops working at times randomly. scrolling through a page and it...just stops and is unresponsive for a good 45 seconds then starts working again.\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel like this laptop will work well. however...had the device came with the processor that was stated this device would have been a Zbook G5 and that was the laptop I was actually interested in purchasing and would have made this so much better of a buy and a 5/5 star. but because of all the misleading information I am not satisfied with this purchase. \r\n\r\nI hope that anyone who is reading this will be able to make a far more informed decision than I did."", ""refurbished items are scary, however most work fine and it's a good value... hope I do not have to put much money into it... just bought it and added a SSHD 512GB, good deal and works like a champ"", 'I use this for my vlogging and it works wonders.

6301880 ,"('The HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 is a premium looking and performing laptop. It has an eye-catching design, and solid specs to back it up. It comes loaded with a 4K touchscreen, NVME SSD storage, and an 8th gen Intel i7. \r\n\r\nSpecs\r\n\r\nCPU – Intel (8th Gen) i7-8565U Quad Core 1.80 GHz processor w/ integrated Intel 620 graphics\r\nMemory – 16GB DDR4-2400\r\nGraphics – Nvidia GeForce MX150 2GB\r\nScreen – 15.6” 3840 x 2160p UHD (4K) IPS w/ anti-glare\r\nStorage – 512GB NVME SSD \r\nPorts – 1X USB C / 1X Thunderbolt / 1X USB 3.0 / 1X HDMI 2.0 / 1X microSD Slot / TRRS 3.5mm Jack (headphone and mic support)\r\nAudio – Bang & Olufsen quad speakers\r\nWebcam – 1080P with dual microphone\r\nDimensions – 14.21 x 9.84 x 0.76”; 4.78lb\r\nOther – Fingerprint Reader / HP Digital Pen / Leather Carrying Pouch\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n\r\nThe design of the Spectre x360 2-in1 is stunning. The packaging that the laptop came in was elegant, and well designed. I was impressed before I even slid the cover of the box to reveal the laptop. Pulling the laptop from its packaging reveals a sturdy feeling heft – it feels expensive. The shell is metal (aluminum I’d assume) with a sandblasted finish that resists smudges. The finish looks dark grey with bronze-chrome accents on the sides and hinges. Overall the design looks really sharp and professional. Opening the laptop, you are greeted by the same color scheme as the outside. The bronze-chrome shows up around the edge of the trackpad and around the entire screen lid. Sticking with the sandblasted metal inside, it again completely resists smudges and fingerprints. \r\n\r\nThe conversion from laptop to tablet is seamless. Like other HP 2-1 products I have used, the hinge provides the right amount of resistance to allow the main body and screen to be used at any number of angles and configurations. The keyboard and trackpad are disabled early enough in the transition to keep errant clicks and button pushes from happening. In tablet mode, the thickness of the machine increases to 0.79” at its thickest points (furthest from the hinges). Sometimes 2-in-1’s take time to figure out how you want to hold them – clicking keys, covering speakers, etc.The Spectre x360 didn’t seem as bad though. The off-center trackpad helped with the initial clumsiness, and the speaker locations aren’t easy covered up. \r\n\r\nI was initially a bit dismayed by the lack of storage location for the pen. I honestly found the magnetic areas for it while measuring the thickness of the laptop in tablet mode with my calipers. The locations are on either side of the palm rest below the control key (on the left) and the enter key on the number pad. It would have been nice to have a location on the side of the laptop (like the Surface Book) for when the laptop is closed. The leather carrying pouch has a pocket to store the pen, which is better than nothing.\r\n\r\nThe ports have an OK layout. The USB’s, Thunderbolt, and microSD are all located on the right side of the body. The HDMI, AC port, and 3.5mm port are on the left. I would have liked to see some additional USB ports located on the other side – 1) for more ports and 2) for flexibility on plugging things in. I am sad that a networking port was not included – instead I will have to pick up a USB C/Thunderbolt to ethernet dongle at some point.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n\r\nThe quad core i7 is a fast, and efficient processor. At only 15W TDP, it is kind to the battery life of the system while still getting the job done quickly. I didn’t notice too much of a performance bottleneck from the processor or the GPU under normal browser/productivity-based activities. Switching programs was seamless, and I never felt any hesitation from the computer to complete a task. The only way I could make the computer feel loaded down was with several tabs in Firefox running Youtube videos, while installing a game from Steam. This is a pretty bogus workload just to get it to feel slow. If you installed some heavy productivity software, or graphic design/modeling software, you could slow it up but that’s about it. In all reality the Spectre x360 has plenty of power and speed thanks to the 16 GB of RAM, and its NVME SSD. \r\n\r\nThe GPU is on the low end, but it is better than the on-die Intel 620 graphics. The MX150 is akin to a GTX 1030 in terms of power, which is still enough to watch/stream 4K Netflix. I tried some limited gaming. I loaded up DiRT Rally (circa 2017) from my Steam library. With the MX150 I had to knock the settings down to low with the resolution set to 1080p (V-Sync off). I was able to get a playable 57/74/100 (min/avg/max) fps with these settings. The x360 should be able to play most games low-med settings and dialed back resolutions. I do have to mention that this was achieved while plugged into AC power. On battery my minimum frames plunged to 25fps and made it unplayable. \r\n\r\nThis version of the Spectre x360 comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB NVME drive for its primary (and only) storage. The 16GB of RAM should be plenty (it can go up to 32, but it is not easily accessible to swap out). The NVME drive is very fast – sequential read/write is 3122.7 / 529.4 Mbs in CrystalDiskMark with 5s intervals and 16GB test file size. 512GB may not be a large enough drive size for some but it should be adequate for the vast majority. If you need more space go for an external drive that can connect via the Thunderbolt port or use cloud storage.\r\n\r\nDisplay\r\n\r\nThe 15.6” 3840 X 2160p UHD IPS touchscreen display looks great. It has a high gloss finish like you would expect in today’s touchscreens. HP lists it as an anti-glare screen as well, which I don’t fully agree with. The screen is glossy enough that you can see the reflection of the keyboard in the screen if the background is dark. The screen is beautiful. This is my first 4K screen period, but I was amazed at how good everything looked. I loaded up several 4K shows on Netflix (Altered Carbon, Planet Earth 2, Blue Planet 2), and they looked great. The screen images were very sharp, colors looked great, and the refresh rate didn’t induce any motion blurring. Even at laptop viewing distance I could not discern individual pixels (282.42 PPI for this screen). \r\n\r\nThe multipoint touchscreen is very responsive, and easy to use. Whether using my finger or the pen, I had no problem interfacing with the OS via the touchscreen. The touch locations were accurate, and it didn’t have any difficulty responding to my inputs. I let my kids have a go at it with a few touchscreen games (Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds), and it didn’t have a problem with their frantic swiping. \r\n\r\nKeyboard and Trackpad\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is a ten-key design (number pad included – Hooray!) with body color match keys. The keys have a white backlight (adjustable high/low/off). The backlight times out after 30 seconds, even on AC power - this is somewhat annoying and would be nice if I could force it to stay on. The keys have a relatively short throw with a full travel length of 0.04” and low to mid force requirement. The key actuation is soft with the actuation point is right in the middle of the key travel. My HP Chromebook has a similar keyboard setup, but its actuation felt closer to the top of the key travel. Either way, the Spectre’s keyboard felt a little more fluid to type on and was nice to use. \r\n\r\nThe trackpad is one of the better ones I have used – and I usually dislike trackpads. It is also body color matched with a satin surface texture, so your fingers glide across it. The multipoint touch was accurate, and the trackpad was responsive. \r\n\r\nHP Digital Pen\r\n\r\nI don’t have a ton of use for the digital pen, but I can see its usefulness. I mostly used it to doodle in MS Paint to draw pictures for my kids. The pen was very easy to use. The included software lets you customize the 2 side buttons to perform whatever action you choose. The pen itself was very accurate – I could sign my name and it would look like my signature on paper. I can see how this pen would be great if you are a teacher grading (digital) papers, an editor marking up a manuscript, etc. For my use simple doodles are fine, and my kids have fun drawing me pictures and saving them (it’s a nice keepsake I guess). Also, 2 extra pen tips are included in the pen box – don’t lose them!\r\n\r\nSound\r\n\r\nThe sound from the B&O quad speakers is great. Like all laptops there is no bass or real low end. The mids and highs were bright and clear, and the speakers had enough sound to fill a room. Dialog sounds clear as well, so watching Netflix or listening to music isn’t a problem. The speakers radiate from the top (above the keyboard) and bottom front (L & R). The bottom front speakers keep the sound pumping out in tablet mode, so obscuring the speakers with your lap won’t be an issue.\r\n\r\nWebcam\r\n\r\nI thought the webcam in the Spectre would be similar to the one in my x360 Chromebook, but this is an improvement. In my x360 CB, the webcam was good in bright lighting but not so much in low light. The Spectre’s webcam is quite a bit better. The sensor is 1080p (FHD), and it performs well in a wide range of lighting. I was able to use it with just the backlight of the screen as the only light source. The mics are also a little better, but still a bit tinny. I can live with that since the picture quality is pretty good. Also, no need to put tape over the lens for privacy since there is a switch on the right side of the laptop that disables the camera. \r\n\r\nOverall\r\n\r\nI am impressed by the Spectre x360. It has plenty of speed and power. The Intel i7-8565U is a great current gen processor that should be able to keep up for years to come. The 512GB NVME drive is seriously quick. The 4K screen is very sharp, and the touch screen is precise. The design of the machine is very eye catching and professional looking. For The majority of use cases this laptop will be perfect and should not disappoint. Gaming is its only weak spot, so be prepared to crank the settings down.', 'Outside looks: \r\nMy first impression of this new Spectre was “wow” absolutely beautiful laptop. It’s actually heavier than I expected and feels like it’s made of very rigid metal. The outside edges are gold colored with the main body in dark brown. The top lid has a satin finish with angled shiny gold colored edges, and a HP logo in gloss gold right in the middle. The bottom of the unit is very plain, the same satin brown finish as the top with two rubber feet running the width of the unit. There are only two screws visible and a long strip of perforations for cooling also running the width of the machine along with two larger exhaust vents on both the left and right side. There are also two perforated speaker ports towards the front corners.\r\n\r\nOn the left edge there is a power button “in an unusual place” mounted on a 45 degree angle next to the power port, then there’s a HDMI out port, a section of exhaust vent and a headphone jack. On the right side there is a lightning bolt port, “set in the corner also at a 45 degree angle like the power button” a USB C port, a full sized USB 3 port, a very tiny switch to turn the camera on/off, another section of exhaust venting and then a micro SD reader “not full sized this time”. The front has nothing on it and the back just has the two very heavy duty solid metal hinges one having and embossed “Spectre” logo in it. \r\n\r\nScreen quality: \r\nThe screen is absolutely gorgeous, the colors are very vibrant and clear. My only complaint and personal preference is that the 3840x2160 resolution can make the text of some applications so small they are almost impossible to read. I would prefer anything 17” and under to have a 1080 screen at most and I’ve adjusted the resolution down to that. Unfortunately when downscaling does make everything larger and easier to read some of the fonts look fuzzy in certain apps. Playing movies the screen is stunning, one of the sharpest screens I’ve seen in a while, and the viewing angles are really wide with very little change from side to side viewing. The screen is covered in high gloss glass and does have quite a bit of reflection to it.\r\n\r\nKeyboard / Trackpad/Pen: \r\nThe keyboard is extremely good on the Spectre laptops and this one keeps up with the previous models.\r\nHP was able to include a keypad which I prefer to have on all my laptops and keep the whole keyboard full sized. There are very small margins on the right and left side of the keyboard and that helped them keep the size close to desktop sized keys. The base is extremely stiff and you really can’t feel any flex in the keyboard while typing. I could easily type on this all day long. The keyboard is also backlit with two levels of brightness available, on high it’s not so bright to be annoying and on low it’s perfect for viewing in a dimly lit room. The one annoyance I have with it, is the backlight automatically shuts off after 30 seconds of in activity. I really dislike this and wish there was an option to have the backlight always on while plugged in. I asked HP support about this and they stated there’s no way to adjust this. \r\n\r\nThe trackpad is nice and big, it’s wider than most, and typical of what HP uses in other machines. It does not have dedicated L/R buttons but the usual pressure sensitive bottom L/R corners, not my favorite either but it works. The multi finger scrolling works most of the time, I’m just not a big fan of track pads and always use an external mouse.\r\n\r\nThe pen is similar to the other pens that came with the other HP laptops I’ve used, it’s very accurate and makes drawing on the screen easy. It is powered by a single AAAA battery and you’ll want to take that out if you don’t use the pen for extended periods. There’s no place to store the pen either so you’ll have to keep track of where you place it.\r\n\r\nSound Quality: \r\nThis Spectre comes with 4 speakers, 2 above the keyboard and another 2 toward the front on the bottom edge. There’s a Bang & Olufsen label on the right just above the keyboard. Sound quality is excellent, very clear and bright, it’s lacking bass but I never expect much bass out of thin portable laptops either. The volume gets fairly loud but not overly, at full volume it was clear and not distorted, just don’t expect it to fill a room, but plenty for sitting and watching a movie in a small area.\r\n\r\nWireless Connectivity: \r\nHP uses an Intel AC-9560 card that includes Bluetooth. My wireless signal was excellent on both 2.4 and 5 GHz, 2.4 giving greater range as usual but the 5 GHz signal never dropped too low while checking it walking around the house. I have 1 GB fiber and was able to get 470Mbps+ up and 380Mbps+ down consistently on the 5 GHz band. I find that pretty amazing as my desktop usually pulls around 350Mbps down at the same distance.\r\n\r\nPorts: \r\nI’ve noticed a trend toward getting rid of ports on the 2-1 machines lately. This one does at least have one full sized USB 3 port on the right side, along with a USB C port and a Lightning bolt capable port.\r\nUnfortunately this didn’t come with any type of adapter for those ports but I did have a USB C to USB 3 hub and that worked perfectly plugging in a thumb drive and an external 1tb hard drive. There’s also a full sized HDMI port on the left side and you can attach either an external monitor or TV there “I haven’t tried this out yet though”. If you like using an external mouse you’ll be using up the one single full sized USB port so you’ll have to get some USB to USB C adapters for anything else you want to connect or use a Bluetooth mouse to free up the full sized port if you really need it.\r\n\r\nGaming performance: \r\nThis Spectre happens to come with the Geforce MX150 and has 2gb of DDR5 memory. It’s good enough for some casual gaming, especially older titles. I installed Steam, set up Fallout 4 and Witcher 3. Fallout 4 runs really good at medium-high settings, on maximum there’s some stutter slower frame rates so I’d never run it more than medium “it still looks great though”\r\nWitcher 3 runs really well on low-medium settings, high is playable and on ultra it’s just way to slow to play enjoyably. Even with the settings on medium the game looks really good on this screen and plays plenty well. The device does get very hot while gaming though.\r\n\r\nInternals and upgrading: \r\nIf you want to open up the unit you have to remove the bottom rubber strips to access the hidden screws, “I won’t be opening this one up to take a look inside but fortunately the maintenance manual is available on HPs website.\r\n\r\nLikes: \r\nThe design, while a little unusual “due to the beveled edges and angled corners”, is visually striking, and everyone I showed it to thought it looked amazing. The weight and how rigid the overall unit is make it feel like a premium laptop.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is excellent, and one of the best I’ve used in a 2n1 laptop. I can type comfortably on it for extended periods without feeling cramped for space. There’s very little flex in the base of the unit and it feels rock solid while typing. With this also having a keypad it feels like it’s more business oriented than a media / gaming laptop.\r\n\r\nOverall speed wise this new Spectre is fast really fast. With this unit having 16 GB of memory and the newest Gen 8 I7-8565U processor and a fast 512 GB SSD drive, it doesn’t have any problems running any desktop software that I threw at it, “MS Office Suite, Photoshop, DVD Creator”. I also streamed videos from Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu without a hitch. The screen “when set at full resolution” looks pretty amazing while watching videos. The 512 GB SSD should be plenty for most people, I’m used to seeing 256 GB drives in these so the extra drive space is nice to have. Geekbench 4 scores were 5198 single core and 16246 multicore, which beats my desktops I7-6700s score of 4675 single core, and almost matches its 16421 multicore score.\r\n\r\nIt comes with both the HP IR camera and finger print reader for security. The IR camera and facial recognition work really well and unlocks the laptop faster than I could put in a password and just as fast as using the finger print reader. When the IR camera activates there are two fast flashing IR illuminator lights on each side of the camera, with these the IR camera can identify you in pretty much any lighting situation. I tried this out by turning off all the lights in the room at night, the screen was the only illumination in the room, and the facial recognition instantly identified me and unlocked the laptop.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeat: \r\nDuring normal use the Spectre never got hot, it stayed plenty cool but when I played any graphic intensive games things really started heating up. After 30 minutes of playing Witcher 3 the keyboard was getting noticeably warm around the WASD keys, and the rest of it was just plain too warm for comfort. My thermal camera shows a top temp around 122 at the left side vent and around that same temp just to the right of the WASD keys. The whole unit was uncomfortably hot after 45 minutes of playing. I’ll be using this laptop for web browsing, work related software, email and media. Light gaming would be fine but anything graphic intensive like Witcher, in my opinion, just gets way too hot for comfort. Under normal use conditions the laptop never heated up anywhere near the Witcher heat levels and remained comfortable even after many hours of use web browsing and watching movies.\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts: \r\nIf you are looking for a top tier business / media laptop that’s convertible and want a larger screen this new Spectre is definitely something well worth considering. This would also be an excellent device for a college student “although expensive”, typing papers on this would be a breeze. The build quality is really outstanding and the metal construction just makes it feel like a premium device, although a little on the heavy side.', ""UNBOXING (5/5):\r\n\r\nThe Spectre x360 15 has a premium unboxing impression. I wasn’t flabbergasted, but it definitely led to some anticipation and excitement. In the box, you get a leather pouch to hold the laptop and HP Pen (which is also included), the laptop itself, the DC power adapter and the documentation. I was not expecting the leather pouch, whatsoever, but was very pleased that HP has included it, so I’ve been using it. It’s a nice snug fit, very professional looking, and the pen can be stowed away in the dedicated slot above the velcro strip. The pouch certainly won’t be holding your DC power adapter, but HP is betting that you won’t need to charge this laptop mid-day.\r\n\r\nBUILD QUALITY (4/5):\r\n\r\nAmong premium 2-in-1 laptops, the Spectre has a very solid all-aluminum chassis with no keyboard flex and average display bend/wobble for a laptop of this caliber. The display hinge is ever-so-slightly off center (HP needs better Quality Assurance), but is quite sturdy, which is certainly reassuring for long-term use. The edges of the device are angled, but don’t feel sharp, so holding it is comfortable. It comes in around 4.5lbs, so this is definitely a heavier machine, despite being thinner. Premium metal designs typically come with this tradeoff, but I’ve personally found it to be worth it, considering the durability as well as experience.\r\n\r\nDISPLAY QUALITY (4/5):\r\n\r\nThe Spectre x360 15” has a 3840x2160 IPS display—specifically the AUO30EB by AU Optronics. It reaches around 400 nits brightness average and looks crisp and clean, as one should expect. If you’re looking to do color sensitive work, I’d advise researching this panel to determine if it meets your needs. That being said, this display is great for productivity and entertainment purposes with no noticeable backlight bleed. I’d love to say this display blew me away, but frankly, I have been spoiled by a Dolby Vision display, and even at only 1080p, the Dolby Vision display’s contrast and vibrance kept my eyes glued to it. Don’t get me wrong, this Spectre’s UHD display is great, but if you’re looking for that WOW factor, I’d advise you to at least research laptops with a Dolby Vision display (which come in both 1080p and UHD variants). That being said, if you aren’t already spoiled with such technology like I am, then this display will still spoil you with crisp, clear images and videos.\r\n\r\nTOUCH SCREEN INPUT (3/5):\r\n\r\nAs for the touchscreen functionality in Windows 10, I found it to be shoddy when trying to scroll on pages in various applications as well as the Chrome Web Browser. This wasn’t the case in Microsoft Edge for some reason. You can expect other aspects to work just fine, but you may encounter lag when trying to performing lengthy swiping gestures in various apps.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some research, it seems like this issue may be attributed to the touch screen’s firmware. Do not try to install firmware from other HP laptop displays, as it will brick your touch screen and pen functionality. Hopefully HP can release a firmware update for this display. I’ve tried getting a hold of them, but they have not been responsive. This lack of touch screen reliability will be a deal breaker for many—and rightfully so, as this Spectre x360 touts itself as a premium 2-in-1, but it’s lacking the touch screen reliability that gimps it as a 2-in-1. Instead, it’s a good premium laptop, but there are already plenty of those at cheaper prices.\r\n\r\nPEN INPUT (2/5):\r\n\r\nHP created a premium-feeling pen, but in application, it’s mostly unreliable. What makes this unreliable is the “pressure sensor” inside the pen. I’ve found that as you tilt, it becomes more difficult for the pen tip to apply enough force to the pressure sensor. As a result, I commonly experience unregistered strokes, and that just leads to a frustrating writing experience. If you were considering using the HP Spectre for lots of pen functionality, this pen is not the most reliable, so I don’t recommend using this PC for that purpose. HP does sell other pens, but I’m not sure those products ultimately lend to better results.\r\n\r\nKEYBOARD (4/5):\r\n\r\nThe keyboard on the Spectre is a pleasure to use, but took me a day or two to get used to. The key presses are relatively quiet, and I think HP was going for that kind of experience, whereas my other 2-in-1 has louder, more tactile key presses and took no adjustment period for me to begin typing at full speed. Even so, the Spectre delivers a typing experience that isn’t cramped or forcing me to extend my fingers beyond their normal comfort. There’s no keyboard flex, making this a very solid typing experience. While I do prefer my other 2-in-1’s keyboard experience, I can definitely say this keyboard outclasses the keyboards on many other laptops that I have owned and reviewed. As a software engineer, I believe this keyboard would lend itself well towards productivity purposes. The keys are backlit and have two brightness modes as well as having the ability to be completely off.\r\n\r\nTOUCHPAD (4/5):\r\n\r\nWith the synaptics drivers, the sensitivity and mouse acceleration felt slow—forcing me to lift my fingers more frequently to move the mouse cursor across the large 15.6” display. After uninstalling the Synaptics driver in the Device Manager under the “Mice and other pointing devices”, it began using the Precision touchpad drivers. I found myself enjoying the experience a lot more, and the sensitivity was perfect. On top of that, all the touchpad gestures began to work flawlessly, lending to increased workflow and productivity.\r\n\r\nSOUND (4/5):\r\n\r\nIn terms of sound quality, the Spectre’s Bang & Olufsen speakers get plenty loud while maintaining clarity without distorting. I personally found it sounded best in the normal laptop mode, but it also sounds good in tent mode. That being said, it does lose some of its resonance in tent mode because the speaker unit above the keyboard will be firing away from you, rather than towards you. HP chose to counter this problem by also putting speakers on the bottom of the chassis, so that you have speakers facing towards you when in tent mode, as well. While I personally think this speaker is outclassed by the Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers found on a different premium 2-in-1 laptop, the Spectre still holds its own by delivering a very enjoyable audio experience that everyone can appreciate.\r\n\r\nI/O (5/5):\r\n\r\nOne advantage that the Spectre has is its availability of ports. It’s equipped with 2 USB-C ports, one of which supports Thunderbolt 3. Either port can be used to charge the Spectre. It also has a standard USB-A port. Additionally, an HDMI port is available for use with an external display, but it should be noted that it defaults to using the Intel UHD Graphics 620 and will only switch to using the MX150 if an application calls for it. There is also a 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo jack, a microSD card slot, and a switch to toggle the webcam connection. Lastly, the DC power jack is the default method of charging the device.\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE (4/5):\r\n\r\nThis is where the Spectre really shines as a 2-in-1. It’s equipped with a quad-core Intel Core i7-8565U with 8 logical threads, 16GB RAM and a Toshiba KXG50ZNV512G NVMe SSD with a drive capacity of 488,386MB. The Spectre delivers excellent performance, considering its lower-voltage CPU. After upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, I was able to run docker containers and a full stack web development environment without hiccups. The SSD is a NVMe drive.\r\n\r\nUtilizing a GTX 1080 in an eGPU, performance was comparable to other Thunderbolt 3-capable laptops and was more reliable than my other premium 2-in-1—as it did not incur any peripheral latency from my mouse and keyboard when stressing the eGPU in a game like Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 3440x1440 at the Highest preset. So if you’re looking for a 2-in-1 capable of being used with an eGPU, I think this Spectre is an excellent choice.\r\n\r\nAs for the Nvidia Geforce MX150, it’s got 2GB of GDDR5 memory for light gaming capability. This GPU is intended more for competitive eSports-type of titles like Rocket League, CS:GO, League of Legends, and the like. You certainly won’t be playing at the native 3840x2160 resolution of the display unless you’re playing 2D titles. Those who are primarily focused on productivity or other media consumption will find that this GPU should do what they want.\r\n\r\nBIOMETRICS (3/5):\r\n\r\nI live in a climate without much humidity during the winter. Sometimes my fingers end up drying and more cracked, but this usually hasn’t been a big deal for fingerprint sensors on smartphones. This Spectre uses an off-the-shelf fingerprint sensor from Synaptics which isn’t particularly great, in my opinion. While it works, it often takes me a few tries. You may have a different experience than myself, but it’s also worth mentioning that this issue is not exclusive to this laptop; rather, it’s commonplace for this particular fingerprint sensor.\r\n\r\nBATTERY (5/5):\r\n\r\nIn terms of battery life, the Spectre x360 is fantastic. I’m easily getting a full day of use with lighter workloads—such as writing up this detailed review. With heavier workloads, you’ll definitely get a few hours, but it will be dependent on your usage. The device charges via the DC power adapter OR through the USB-C ports. I’m pleased to say that I’ve used third-party 65W and 100W USB-C chargers with this laptop successfully. I do like that you have the choice between DC or USB-C charging, unlike some laptops which only charge through one or the other. Having more options is better!\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3/5):\r\n\r\nAs it stands today, this Spectre x360 does not quite live up to the great expectations of a '2-in-1'. While it’s a great as a premium laptop, it doesn’t make sense to pay the extra cost for an unreliable touch screen and pen. If HP can fix the issues regarding the touch screen and pen, I’d give it a solid recommendation."", 'Last year, around this time I purchased the HP 15"" xSpectre 360 laptop from Best Buy and fell in love. It is simply said, the best laptop I have ever had the pleasure to own. This year, I had a need to replace an aging computer, so without reservation, I chose this years newer HP 15"" Spctre x360 15-df0013dx. This is HP\'s most powerful Spectre yet and it\'s everything last years model is in terms of goodness and then some! \r\n\r\nOne simply can\'t overlook the sheer beauty of these machines. The Dark Ash Silver with Copper Accents is simply stunning. And the quality feel of every aspect of this laptop reeks of luxury in design and parts. It just doesn\'t look or feel like your average laptop. And to be honest it isn\'t your average laptop. \r\n\r\nThe screen is simply stunning. First of all, it\'s Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it\'s 4K. Trust me, 4K Video is rendered in as good as the best 4K TV clarity you could own, maybe even better! It\'s immersive on steroids, with over 8.2 million pixels, covering 3840x2160 resolution. The 8th Generation Quad Core Intel i7 Processor with NVIDIA GeForce Graphics provides the graphic power to do anything you could want. \r\n\r\nThis laptop comes with 512GB of blistering fast SSD Storage, with a battery that can go up to 16 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. I remember when a charge of 4 or 5 hours was considered amazing! Add in 16 GB of RAM and 8 GB Cache and this is one powerful lightweight powerhouse. It weighs an astonishingly low 4.79 LBS and is only .76 thick.\r\n\r\nThis laptop is Windows Ink able and comes with a HP Digital Pen in Dark Ash Silver. Use this with a photo editing app and the options are endless in what you can do. And the audio system is from Bang & Olufsen, with HP Quad Speakers. Translation: It provides some of the best sound on any laptop I\'ve ever heard.\r\n\r\nIn terms of connectivity, you get: \r\n\r\n1 USB-C 3.1 Type A port \r\n1 Thunderbolt 3 port \r\n1 USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type A \r\n1 HDMI 2.0 port 1 Headphone Jack. \r\n\r\nIf there is any disappointment and this one is minor is the laptop only provides a Micro-SD card reader. I don\'t have any gear that uses Micro-SD cards. I need to figure out how to use my SDXC memory cards, but I\'m sure there are adapters for that.\r\n\r\nSetup with this laptop was so easy. I mean So So easy. I have a backup service for all my files, so I turned the laptop on and the Windows assistant walked me through the initial setup for Wifi, etc, performs some updates and let\'s you choose from three ways to sign in using your face, your fingerprint or a self defined Passcode. From there, I simply logged into the backup service, got all my files, documents and photos put exactly where I had them and installed all the other things I use such as Office 365 and Adobe Creative Cloud, seamlessly and easily. Since I also have a HP Tango Printer (I really recommend this printer), connecting to the printer was instantaneous and gone are the days of having to downloading printer drivers. \r\n\r\nSo there you have it. I\'ll break the Pros and Cons down this way:\r\n\r\nPros: Just about everything I wrote above - Really!\r\nCons: I wish this came with a SDXC Card Reader and that\'s about the only wish I have.\r\n\r\nIf you can\'t tell, I\'m beyond sold on these HP Spectre laptops. They ooze quality, they ooze design sophistication and they just work beautifully.', 'Having been a serious geek in the computer and software industry for many years, it takes something really special to impress me. The new HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 laptop is one of the most impressive laptops that I have come across in many years. \r\n\r\nUnboxing\r\nHP has something special with this model and they love to show it. As soon as I opened the shipping box I was impressed with the laptop box itself, a flat black top with the metallic copper word SPECTRE in the center and a very sturdy all white base. It was as if HP was shipping me a large piece of jewelry. When I removed the lid I did indeed discover a beautiful jewel of a laptop. The combination of carbon fiber grey top with copper hinges and the HP logo in the middle implied “quality craftsmanship”, which was reiterated by the view of the keyboard and monitor after I raised the lid. The inside of this jewel revealed a beautifully smooth Gorilla Glass display above the copper hinges, a Bang and Olufsen speaker stretched across the width of the base above the keyboard, an ash grey full keyboard is spaced comfortably across the base, and more than ample touchpad sits at an offset left, but centered below the spacebar. A small fingerprint scanner pad sits just below the period key of the numeric keys. The base is metal and has the look and feel of quality manufacturing. The sides of the base have extensive venting slots for cooling, USB-C port, USB port, USB Thunderbolt port, Audio out, a camera privacy switch, HDMI, and SD card slot. The bottom of the laptop has additional base speakers.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\nA single page setup guide with pictures was more than enough for knowing where to attach cables. Though I clearly didn’t pay attention to it since it took me a couple minutes to find the power switch, which is neatly hidden in the beveled top left edge of the laptop. After powering up, Windows Cortana voice provided the instructions for setup, including keyboard type selection, fingerprint registration, wifi selection, Windows updates, sending of an integration app to my iPhone, and enabling of the included digital stylus pen. It was all easy to step through without any glitches. \r\n\r\nSpecifications\r\nThis laptop comes with some significant horsepower at a very reasonable price. \r\n • 500 GB Solid State Digital drive\r\n • Intel Core i7-8565U CPU @ 1.8 GHz 1.99 GHz\r\n • 16 GB RAM\r\n • Windows 10 Home, 64 bit\r\n • Fingerprint scanner\r\n • Full-size backlit keyboard\r\n • 15.6 inch, UHD Gorilla Glass Touch Screen Display\r\n • Built for Windows Ink digital stylus\r\n • Bang & Olufsen speakers\r\n • GeForce MX150\r\n • Preinstalled with \r\n ○ McAfee Security\r\n ○ Netflix\r\n ○ Microsoft apps\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\nThe first thing I wanted to test was the sound quality of the Bang & Olufsen speakers. I did this after installing Apple iTunes. The speakers are very clear and crisp. A lot of the bass was lost when having the laptop flat on the desk. Once I elevated it in a tilted stand then the bass speakers came through a lot better. Since I’ll be using this laptop for development and writing, I installed VS Pro 2017 with MS SQL Server. Thanks to the high-speed wifi and the SSD drive, the installation was the fastest I’ve seen yet. For a good test of the GeForce graphics I installed Civilization V and No Man’s Sky. I followed this with my normal set of tools for writing and development: VS Code, NotePad++, Scrivener, and some utilities. \r\n\r\nThe development tools are crazy fast on this laptop. With the combination of the SSD drive and the Intel Core i7 CPU running at 1.8 GHz with 16 Gig of RAM, the Spectre is a serious developer’s laptop. As a development machine, with the screen brightness at around 70%, I was able to easily squeeze out 7 hours of battery life with more left over. HP says 10 hours, but I did have music playing as well. While I’m impressed that this comes with the GeForce MX150 graphics card, the laptop reverts to the built-in Intel graphics chips for normal use. I’m assuming this is to help conserve battery life. I confirmed this with a solid hour of Civ 5 in tablet mode. (Which is an awesome feat due to amazing screen touch responsiveness.) The battery went from 100% to 41% after an hour and the laptop got pretty hot from the intensive graphics. The Gorilla Glass does a pretty good job of resisting finger smudges when in tablet mode.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nIn the past I have not been a big fan of HP laptops. Coming from Apple devices for most of my past laptops, I had some high expectations. The HP Spectre x360 far exceeded my expectations! The size and weight are just right for my laptop needs. I love the rubber strips on the bottom for preventing sliding of the laptop when it is laying flat on my glass desktop. (I know. It’s the simple things.) This is the first laptop I’ve seen which easily switches from laptop to tablet mode and back without confusing the Windows environment. When I’m at home this is my primary desktop computer and is attached to an external monitor via HDMI and an external mechanical keyboard. It works great as a serious home computer. While I’m not a serious gamer, I do appreciate the higher quality of graphics that the GeForce provides, as long as I do my gaming while plugged into power instead of relying on the battery for more than an hour. For steaming movies, the beautiful screen combined with the Bang & Olufsen speakers provides a great experience. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this beautiful jewel of a laptop for any developer or casual laptop user. It is not a serious gaming laptop, but it will provide enjoyable moments of quality gaming. While the price might seem a little high for a non-serious gaming laptop, the quality of the materials and the craftsmanship makes it worth the money, especially when you’re at the coffeeshop and people start asking about it. I would give it 6 stars if I could.', 'The HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 laptop features a metal design, with a sleek look and colors. However, the body design is questionable. While working on my desk, I felt the laptop wobble a bit. I am not sure if the rubber feet in place are stable enough. Since this is a 15"" display, it is a bit bulkier than other 2-in-1 laptops in its class. You cannot use the stylus on-the-go like other 2-in-1 laptops. The stylus comes separate from the shell; it does require you to carry it with the laptop which is not necessarily convenient. However, that is because of the 15"" screen size and thin body. HP did include a nice leather case with it that does hold the laptop and the stylus. So this makes up for the ""pop-out"" feature that most 2-in-1 laptops feature.\r\n\r\nWhile using it in tablet mode, I felt that the Spectre was again, too bulky, because of the large screen size and weight the laptop carries. I would not recommend using it in tablet mode since it is cumbersome to use. It was not easy to take notes on it or test the pen features. \r\n\r\nOne feature that is prevalent in the Spectre x360 is the SD card slot; it is a full-size slot. Those who upload photographs or other data will like this feature. In previous 2-in-1 laptops, I have owned, there was no SD card slot. Also included are an HDMI out port and a 3.1 USB port for fast data upload. Seeing an HDMI port in the Spectre x360 is refreshing since my old 2-in-1 required a conversion cable for this. \r\n\r\nThe display is a 4K video display (3,840 x 2,160 pixels) and 60hz refresh rate. While testing 4K video content on YouTube and other websites, the laptop started humming loudly and overheating. When I scaled down the video, the Spectre x360 did not hum loudly or overheat. I am not sure why this happened since the Spectre x360 features an AMD RX Vega M graphics chip. Not to mention it has an i7 core processor. I continued to test 4K video content with, unfortunately, the same results. Again, it has a stunning display with bright colors, but I am cautious to continue playing 4K content when the laptop continues to overheat, and the fans continue to ""hum"" loudly. \r\n\r\nThe keyboard is OK; the keys are too low, unfortunately. I frequently pressed other keys on the keyboard and it did not feel comfortable under my fingers. However, the keyboard is backlight functional, which the user can turn on or off with ease. What some 2-in-1 laptops, like the Spectre x360, are doing is including a fingerprint scanner for faster sign-on functions, as well as security. The fingerprint sign-on feature for me is easier to use, and I commend HP for including it in the Spectre x360.\r\n\r\nThe battery life of the Spectre x360 is ok; while running background apps and updates (on a full charge) for about an hour, the battery already drained to 70%. While watching the 4K video on YouTube (the battery drained to 60% in about twenty minutes). My suggestion is to find a middle ground and not run 4K video and be careful with what you run in the background of the Spectre x360. Multitasking seems to drain the battery at a fast rate, but the processor does allow you to multitask without a hangup, which is a plus.\r\n\r\nOverall, the HP Spectre x360 is a beautiful looking laptop, with questionable designs to the keyboard and mobility (weight and bulky exterior for tablet usage). The 4K display is stunning, but only for a short time until it heats up, and the fans hum loudly. HP still has some work to do with the Spectre line. However, they are trending in the right direction with most of their design choices.', ""Overall this is a great laptop, its fast, quiet, light weight, and the battery is amazing...However I did have to exchange it TWICE until I got a version that didn't have any issues....\r\n\r\nThe first two that I purchased / exchanged had an issue with the monitor. The first had an overwhelming yellowish tint to it...see the attached image (laptop on the left is this model, and the laptop on the right is my other / older hp laptop) \r\n\r\nAfter exchanging that one for another one, I noticed that the second one had a similar issue but only on the left side off the screen. The right side started out normal, and transitioned to a darker / more yellowish tint as you went to the left.\r\n\r\nI decided to give an exchange one last shot, since BestBuy had received a new batch, and luckily this one had no issues."", '')"

6240850 ,"('This little thing is surprisingly poppy. I never really had an interest in Chromebooks as I always thought of them as cheap laptops just for browsing the web and email. However, the X2 has really changed my opinion on them and even convinced a co-worker to get one. \r\n\r\nThe X2 is a essentially a decent sized tablet with an attachable keyboard. The keyboard itself is very responsive and the leather like texture is soft and makes it look like some designer style bag. The touchpad is nicely set in the center making it easy to use with either hand and is as responsive as touching the screen. There are no function keys (F1-12) but a whole row of keys assigned specific functions, such as brightness and volume, making it easy for quick adjustments. \r\n\r\nAs far as treating it as a tablet, it easily detaches from the keyboard and instantly recognizes that it is no longer attached showing the on screen keyboard for applications that require it. The screen itself feels very sturdy, however where the front facing speakers are it feels like a slight weak point and tends to scare me when squeezing those edges. There is a fairly large bezel around the screen, ⅝” all the way around. However, this gives plenty of room for a thumb to be holding the tablet without touching the screen. \r\n\r\nAs far as the screen I am truly surprised at the resolution. This screen is sharp, clear and bright. When I first received it I started playing 4K videos on Youtube and could have sworn it was a 4K screen. However, the specs state it is only 2400 x 1600, which is still impressive considering my 17” laptop still only does 1920x1080.\r\n\r\nThe most common use I have had for my Chromebook has been watching videos, from Youtube and Netflix mostly. With the front facing stereo speakers audio is pretty decent, however I mostly use headphones. When attached to the keyboard the hinge keeps the screen at the desired angle and is surprisingly balanced for how far back it can tilt. \r\n\r\nAn active stylus and AAA battery is also included, as well as a tip tool and 3 additional tips. There are two tips that a more pointed, to give a pen type feel, and two that are more rounded, to give a pencil type feel. The tips are more of a personal feel as far as fine tip and broad tip but do not have much more of a difference to them that I noticed. However, using the stylus to draw on the Chromebook felt really satisfying and really inspired me to want to draw more. As many Android applications are supported through the Google Play store you have plenty of drawing options.\r\n\r\nAs for applications, there is the Chrome Web Store and the Google Play store. The Chrome store had most essentials but having been used to Google Play store from my Android devices I felt like it was missing some common applications. However, for the most part many of the applications through the Play store are supported with a few quirks here and there. For instance, some applications responded weird to the on screen keyboard by capitalizing every word I typed while not providing any auto features when I used the keyboard.\r\n\r\nAs for the surprisingly poppy portion, it is really noticable when opening web pages. I use Chrome on my Windows laptop yet it feels faster while using it on the Chromebook. Pages just seem to load faster in general. The same is true for when you open and close the device and the Wi-Fi connection as it is put to sleep to conserve battery but quickly reconnects to the network when opened up or pressing the power button.\r\n\r\nAs for battery life it gets me through the day if actively using it. As for the past 2 weeks I have only briefly used it to check email and light browsing in the afternoon and have yet to charge it again. So, the standby function is doing really well at conserving the battery. I forgot my charger one day that I let it run dead and used my cell phone USB-C charger instead. Though it recognized it as a slow-charger, it managed to get me through the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nUpon setting the device up for the first time I noticed it used Google Docs online and I thought for sure that meant I could only use it when online. However, once you have logged into your Google account it retains a cache of documents created through Google Docs and you can later access other items once back online if you have not downloaded them to your device.\r\n\r\nHaving been a primarily Windows PC user the Chrome OS was a bit different, however, having used Android based phones for some time now there are plenty of similarities. Using this Chromebook is very much like a blend between the styles of devices. Also, with this Chromebook having an Intel chipset you can enable developer mode and run Linux if you want to try something a little more technical. Once installed, swapping between the two operating systems is seamless. \r\n\r\nI’d say my only real complaint about this HP Chromebook X2 is the white surface on the back of the screen is making it look like I abuse the poor thing, collecting every little bit of a scuff mark.', 'HP Chromebook X2 12-F014DX\r\n\r\nThe HP Chromebook X2 is the first Chromebook with a detachable keyboard that also runs Android apps enabling it to function both as a Chrome OS laptop and as a high end Android tablet.\r\n\r\nMy initial impression of the hardware was that it felt like a high end device with premium build quality. The tablet itself was made of aluminum and felt solid. The screen was super sharp with rich and vibrant colors. The touchpad was responsive and had a nice click to it. Being new to Chrome OS, I had to learn how it responds to touch gestures using the touchpad. Once I got used to the basics, I was able to use two fingers to scroll around documents, three fingers to move around tabs, and two fingers (instead of one finger) to tap/click the touchpad to bring up the context menu. The touchpad easily and correctly distinguish all my gestures.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard felt good (although the smaller sized layout makes some compromises compared to a full-sized keyboard causing me to type the wrong character more than I would like). The leather-like texture on the keyboard was a nice touch.\r\n\r\nSetting up was extremely easy. Just connect to my home network and log into my Google account and all my bookmarks and passwords were migrated so my browsing experience was exactly the same as on my Windows desktop. Since Chrome OS boots so much faster than Windows, this makes it the ideal machine to use if you just want to quickly get on the internet to browse around. When I first set it up, it immediately found an update. The update actually took a little longer to finish than what I expected it to take but it was still orders of magnitude faster than updates on a Windows machine. Another update on a later date was even faster.\r\n\r\nSince I’m new to Chrome OS, I’m still trying to figure things out. I’m using Google Docs to write this review to see if Chrome OS could be viable as a main computer. Instead of Google Docs, we also have the choice of using Microsoft Office 365 as either a Chrome Extension (which is called Office Online) or by using the Android Apps version available on the Google Play Store.\r\n\r\nIt’s a little bit confusing since the HP Chromebook X2 can run both. Which version of a program should we install if there is both a Chromebook and an Android version available? Right now, if there is both a Chromebook and Android version, I will favor installing the Chromebook version.\r\n\r\nThere are two USB-C ports that can be used for data transfer, charging and display (I only tested the charging part) as well as a Micro SD slot that accepted my Sandisk 128 GB card with no problems. I’m not sure how external memory is handled in Chrome OS. Is this memory available for installing more apps? On some of my Android phones, I would run out of memory for installing or updating apps even when I had a large SD memory card installed. Android would not let me install apps on my SD card and would only let me use it to store music or picture files. I don’t know if Chrome OS has the same limitations. With 32GB of internal storage, I probably won’t run out of memory for apps but it would be nice if I knew that external memory is also available for installing applications.\r\n\r\nThe HP Chromebook X2 also comes bundled with HP’s Active Pen that supposedly uses Wacom AES technology. From briefly playing around with the pen, I think it’s good enough for artists who want to use it for drawings or sketching. \r\n\r\nAndroid apps start in a smaller window with the option of running in full screen. The Chromebook version of Netflix ran perfectly with great video quality. The Android app version of Amazon Prime Video did not run well and had lots of stuttering. The SiliconDust HDHomerun Android app sometimes had trouble finding my HDHomerun tuner on the network. But when it did find it, it ran great. Sound from the front side speakers was capable of filling the room with clear and crisp sound but felt a little tinny to me.\r\n\r\nMy favorite Android app for the HP Chromebook X2 was Comixology! Comics look absolutely beautiful on that large super sharp screen! With the keyboard detached and running in full tablet mode, the HP Chromebook X2 is a gorgeous comic book reader. It might be a little too large to hold comfortably for long periods but the screen is just gorgeous for reading comic books.\r\n\r\nBattery life has been excellent. With light use, I was able to get about 5 days of use without needing to charge.\r\n\r\nThe HP Chromebook X2 in laptop mode is perfect for web browsing, email, and other light desktop usage (such as word processing and spreadsheets). It’s also a fantastic media consumption device (Youtube, Netflix and Comixology etc.). With its ability to run Android apps it can also function as a high end Android tablet. I think HP hit a home run with the HP Chromebook X2.', 'First off, this is my second Chromebook, however first 2-in-one. \r\n\r\nTechnical Issues? Nope, surprisingly!\r\n\r\nThere were a ton of things that I liked … including:\r\nQuick WiFi acquisition -- when opening the clamshell, it got a wifi signal very quickly. \r\nPrinting - worked fine with my HP 5200 series wireless printer\r\n\r\nThe display comes set to a very low resolution, so I bumped it up to 1500x1000; the max resolution made it impossible for me, with great eyesight, to use it. \r\n\r\nI listen to a ton of music during the day -- let’s say 10hours/day. I found there to be seamless audio casting with Google Play Music to any Google device in the house. Also, it connects to a Bose Soundlink Mini via Bluetooth without issue as well.\r\n\r\nAnother very good feature is that there is NOT a proprietary connector to charge it … it uses a USB-C Charger, but requires so much juice to charge, that normal fast-chargers won’t touch it. At least you can use THAT charger to charge your phone, etc. \r\n\r\nOh, and it has 2x USB-C ports, so you can still hook up a flash drive if needed. Let’s not forget about the microSD card slot for additional storage as well, though at 32GB on this unit & everything going to the cloud -- I didn’t find myself struggling for free space. \r\n\r\nThere is a solid feeling keyboard. It’s a good size given the tablet portion and the trackpad is perfectly centered - so it’s easy movement between typing & moving the cursor. The magnets are strong and takes a good tug to disconnect it from the keyboard, which doesn’t have a power source itself, thus doesn’t need to be charged in addition to the tablet.\r\n\r\nThe camera is decent, however I didn’t find myself bringing it outside to use so I can’t compare it to my S8+ in regards to quality (and I didn’t research the specs on this camera either, FWIW).\r\n\r\nSomething that REALLY shocked me was how minima the fingerprints were … not like the iPads of yesteryear. \r\n\r\nLastly, a pen is new to me, and until I get a real need for it, is somewhat in the way, so I keep it attached to my old 13in MacBook Pro’s Incase pouch.\r\n\r\nWith the Pros, there are almost always some cons. This device has a lot less than I had expected, so here we go …\r\n\r\nThe front-facing speakers (like the Nexus 9) are good but not great; when I see something purposely marked B&O (Bang & Olufsen), I expect more than some tinny output. \r\n\r\nThe screen is a bit wobbly when taking photos while docked to the keyboard, mainly because the display is a HEAVY ‘tablet’ piece. When I was doing some basic video recording on the rear facing camera I definitely had low-light focusing issues. \r\n\r\nCan’t [easily] rename the device -- which can be annoying for those with naming conventions\r\n\r\nApps:\r\nNot all are major Android Apps are ready for ChromeOS - it seems like they want to get away from “Apps” and move to Cloud-driven, so -- GMAIL isn’t an App by default, it directs you to Chrome & the gmail web page. \r\n\r\nHere are some Apps that I came across that just don’t work:\r\nNetflix (but the website works fine)\r\nBlink Camera\r\nFing\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up there is plenty of horsepower for the type of use that I’m giving it and I’m a power user in all aspects of technology.', 'Have never had interest in Chromebooks, they were limited in functionality in my world.\r\n\r\nThat changed in a big way when I got my hands on the HP Chromebook X2. It packs a punch and offers the functionality that works in my world from silky smooth web browsing to office functions and beyond. When I say silky smooth that is an excellent description of the speed and response time in the Chrome browser. To my surprise it smokes my home built “beast” desktop in web browsing, the desktop beast has tested out faster than 99 percent of the world’s computers. Yikes, the Chromebook has come a long way.\r\n\r\nFirst impression when I saw the HP X2 as we took it out of the box was the stunning design. The pearl white lid is brilliant. That goes along way as I plan to set the unit up for my wife, she loves the look. Couple kudos in my back pocket when she realizes the X2 is hers. \r\n\r\nAfter working on the laptop, the last two days setting it up must confess a little jealously that I will not be using the computer. It is fast, everything I have thrown at it from office products, browsing difficult web-pages that typically load slowly, to crunching numbers have not fazed this little brute in any way. It smoothly sails threw all the operations I have thrown at it, I am amazed.\r\n\r\nSetting up the HP X2 is almost effortless. It is well prepared and executed through all the steps.\r\n\r\nSurprised at how similar the Chrome GUI interface they have delivered is to the Windows GUI, feels right at home immediately.\r\n\r\nScreen has an excellent picture, solid colors. Movies look superb.\r\n\r\nRely heavily on Office 365 for business as well as home tasks, all the apps are available on Google Play Store and hooked up with our Office 365 account effortlessly. Installed OneDrive to complete the hooks into our Microsoft ecosystem, so far works like a charm.\r\n\r\nIf you plan on using your “old” USB stuff, well that has become so yesteryear, you will need to step up to USB 3.0 type C power connectors. Kudos.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a mouse I would suggest going Bluetooth, which was my first thought as I have never liked the touch pad mouse thingy. Now that I have used this computer I find the touch pad quite nice, highly accurate and with the touch screen and the stylus I could see myself hanging the mouse up, maybe. \r\n\r\nCPU, Memory and storage are fast, that is always a big plus. Storage is 32GB which appears to leave you with about 20.5GB for storing your stuff. After loading several of the Microsoft Office Apps and other base programs I am now at 17GB of free space. \r\n\r\nThe storage may seem tight and will be for some but is simply resolved by adding MicroSD memory in the speed and size you desire.\r\n\r\nBattery life is very strong. Topped off the charge yesterday and the machine has been in use and running for many hours the last two days and I am left with a 60% charge. Like that. Wi-Fi is top notch supporting two band connectivity.\r\n\r\nMy wish is that the keyboard was backlighted, for me it is tough as I use my laptop on the coffee table at night watching the tube. The Oxford Blue on the interior of the unit does not help seeing the keys in dim light. On the other hand, my wife who will be using the HP X2 never uses her backlighted keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nBottom-line, I love this little laptop and it delivers a nice blend of performance, quality build and hits all the right notes for a highly productive computing device. Have now become a convert and admire the Chromebook tech.', 'Overall I have enjoyed using this product as it feels very durable and has a responsive keypad. It is a little on the weighted side when you have the keyboard attached and make top heavy. So if using it as a portable laptop be aware it is not balanced well between the screen and keyboard.

The mic was able to pick up voices without any issues from a close to average distance without distortion. I am a little disappointed that there were not more USB connections on the screen however understand that helps kept the cost down.\r\n\r\nKeypad - \r\nThey keypad felt great when using, I love how the keys and touch-pad are very responsive. It uses a connection to connect versus Bluetooth which in my opinion is better as I always run into anyone millisecond delays on Bluetooth keypads. The keypad is powered by the connection to the screen so there is no separate charging needed. The side of the keypad has a thin fabric to hold the stylus. It is thoughtful however at times find it getting caught on bags and carry cases.\r\n\r\nCharging -\r\nThe charging was fast and the cords are nice and long. I am very impressed with the quick charge ability this has. The adapter is small and makes it easy to carry in the case with the Chromebook. I like the added feature of a light next to both USB - C connectors indicating a charge. On my older competitive model it only had one light so if plugged into another USB - C you are in the dark of charging status.\r\n\r\nI have really enjoyed this product and would recommend it based on the price, usage and functionality.', 'I LOVE this machine! I have been a fan of Chomebooks since their arrival, and this model has everything I have been looking for. As the first true 2 in 1 model (as far as I can tell) it not only brings everything you would expect from a typical Chromebook, but also a unique versatility. The ability to use the machine as a standalone tablet is fantastic. To top it all off, it comes with great build quality and the feel and looks of a premium device. The best of all worlds.\r\n\r\nLike I said in my opening, it more or less has everything I was looking for. The weight is nice, while still having a good feel in the hand. It feels well-built. It looks well-built. It has a sleek design, with a nice color combination. Design is not all about looks, however, and here, HP does not disappoint. They thrive. \r\n\r\nThe machine is quick and responsive, has great connectivity (USB-C and SD reader thank you!), a surprisingly great (and detachable and comfortable) keyboard and touch pad and a BEAUTIFUL 3 by 2 IPS screen that is bright, crisp, vivid, and responsive. You will love the screen. Beyond that, I was impressed with the sound level and quality of the speakers. It is not studio level quality, and does not have a lot of bass, but it more than met my expectations. The battery life is excellent, consistently giving me an entire day of use with quite a bit of room to spare. Lastly, HP includes a pen/stylus, (they call it Active Pen) which other brands require you to buy separately, and I like the functionality it provides, especially when combined with the 2 in 1 capabilities of this machine. They also add a pen loop to the side of the keyboard for storage. Another nice little bonus.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I really like this laptop. It is unique, feature-rich, performs well and delivers all of this in a premium build, while being a great value at a less than premium price. If you are in the market for a Chromebook or a “traditional” laptop, you should definitely give this a look.', '======= Summary =======\r\n\r\nThe HP Chromebook X2 is my first Chrome OS and Chromebook experience and I really like it~! The hardware is sleek and premium, the display is crisp and bright, the keyboard and touchpad are excellent, the tablet mode is really awesome, and the Chrome OS software and apps work flawlessly and fluidly. And the battery life is simply superb~!! I\'ve only used Windows computers since 1994 and it took me only a day or two to quickly adjust to the new software and how it all works. Great product from HP~! \r\n\r\n\r\n***Pros:\r\n\r\n1. Premium build materials and design.\r\n2. Bright and crispy screen.\r\n3. Excellent keyboard and touchpad.\r\n4. Superb battery life.\r\n5. Useful stylus/pen.\r\n6. Easy to use as both a laptop or a tablet.\r\n7. Fast & performant.\r\n8. Easy to maintain and keep the computer updated.\r\n9. Google Play Store app support (i.e., lots and lots of apps available).\r\n10. Relatively light (~3 lbs) and easy to carry around. Only 1.5 lbs if used as a tablet.\r\n11. Expandable storage via microSD card.\r\n\r\n\r\n***Cons:\r\n\r\n1. Chrome Extensions work a bit differently in ChromeOS than in a Windows 10 environment & Chrome browser. \r\n2. Slight learning curve if new to Chrome OS (e.g., keyboard shortcuts, file management, network sharing). \r\n3. The main rear-camera is slow and not very good (compared to mid- and flagship level smartphones).\r\n4. Only 32GB of onboard storage.\r\n5. Some Android apps have compatibility issues.\r\n6. Custom arrangement of apps and folders inside the ""App Drawer"" is not saved and resets after a shutdown/restart.\r\n7.

No unattended remote access option. \r\n\r\n\r\n======= General Design & Build Quality =======\r\n\r\nThe HP Chromebook X2 is quite a looker. I love its aluminum ceramic white lid design paired up with a leathery textured dark navy keyboard. The metal sideframe feels premium and solid. The touchpad feels nice and it has just the right amount of ""clickiness"" and pressure response when clicking on it. The keys on the keyboard feel good as well - definitely made of higher-quality plastic with a slight texture to it that I appreciate. This $600 Chromebook X2 feels more premium than many Windows laptops that cost $1000 or more. Compared to my $1,300 HP Spectre 13 Windows 10 laptop, it looks and feels just as premium and high-quality. Complete win from HP~!!\r\n\r\nDetaching the screen and using the Chromebook X2 as a tablet is very sleek and nice. It only weighs ~1.5 lbs and it feels light and well-balanced. I experienced no awkward handling issues. \r\n\r\n======= Screen =======\r\n\r\nThe 2400x1600 (240 dpi) 12.3"" screen is excellent~! It is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it gets bright enough to comfortably use even in outdoors. The screen registers finger taps and gestures instantly and accurately. In addition, everything looks very sharp and crispy. Watching movies and music videos is a very nice experience. Wonderful stuff, no complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n======= Keyboard =======\r\n\r\nI highly enjoy typing on the Chromebook X2. The keys are responsive, has a nice matte finish and some texture to it, and repels dirt and oil very well. I only wish there were some additional keys that I\'m used to having on my Windows laptops (e.g., Pg Up, Pg Dn, Fn, Home, End, Prt Sc, and Caps Lock).\r\n\r\n\r\n======= Touchpad =======\r\n\r\nThe touchpad is sized just right for me. It\'s not too small nor too big. It feels very solid and smooth when running my fingers across it and gestures are detected accurately and consistently. The pressure required to register a click is just right as well. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I miss from the touchpad are customization options. I would love it if ChromeOS offered custom gesture creations similar to Microsoft\'s Precision Touchpad gestures. \r\n\r\n \r\n======= Performance =======\r\n\r\nMy Chromebook X2 is equipped with a 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core m3-7Y30 CPU (1.00 to 2.60 GHz, 4MB cache, 2 Cores & 4 Threads), 4GB of LPDDR3-1600 RAM, Intel HD Graphics 615, 32GB eMMC internal storage, and Intel 2x2 802.11ac Wifi and Bluetooth. Paired up with ChromeOS (7.1.1 Nougat), the computer is able to handle everything I throw at it - opening up Chrome with 26 tabs, playing music in the background via YouTube, working on documents via Google Docs and Keep, and more. I was very pleasantly surprised by how well it kept up with my more powerful HP Spectre 13 Windows 10 laptop (Intel Core i7 8550U CPU with 4 Cores & 8 Threads, 8GB DDR3 RAM, and 1TB Samsung 960 Evo NVME SSD). \r\n\r\nI haven\'t run into a single instance where I felt that the Chromebook X2 is slow or sluggish. I\'m highly satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n======= Audio =======\r\n\r\nThe audio performed to my expectations and satisfaction. The volume doesn\'t get very loud and the bass, of course, is lacking in such a slim formfactor but I experienced no distortions and properly enjoyed all the music and videos I watched. I think it will be good enough and satisfactory for most people.\r\n\r\n\r\n======= Software (ChromeOS) =======\r\n\r\nThis is my first experience with ChromeOS and I was delighted by its performance, clean interface, ease of use, and low learning curve. Everything about it has been easy to use - the initial setup process, updating ChromeOS, and finding and installing apps from the Chrome Web Store and the Google Play Store. Almost all of the Android apps I installed to the Chromebook worked without a hiccup and were resized correctly to my satisfaction. \r\n\r\nI only have a few things on my wishlist for ChromeOS: (1) Easy connection to Windows shared folders on the home network, (2) A better and more flexible file management system like on Windows & File Explorer, (3) Unattended remote access functionality, (4) A more customizable ""Shelf"" and ""App drawer,"" and (5) Ability to add custom touchpad gestures.\r\n\r\nWith Google constantly improving ChromeOS and Chromebooks now having access to the Google Play Store and Linux apps, the future is very bright and promising. I only expect the software side of things to get better and better from here on out. \r\n\r\n\r\n======= My Verdict =======\r\n\r\nI\'m very happy with the HP Chromebook X2. It\'s premium in its design and build, it works very well as both a laptop and a light 12"" tablet, app support and variety is dynamic and wide-ranging, performance is great, battery life is superb, and Google is constantly improving ChromeOS. HP has created an excellent machine with high value - not for just being a Chromebook but even when compared to Windows laptops that cost a lot more. It\'s a Slam Dunk from HP~!!', '')"

Small enough to be portable but great for the desk as well.', ""This is my first time buying a Ryzen based computer of any kind. \r\n\r\nI am quite pleased that HP decided to implement mounting and connections for the NVMe drive, because that gave this very slow (on the original platter drive) computer a swift kick in the rear for speed and performance. As soon as I got it home, the very first thing I did was to take off the back panel (screws are hiding under the rubber feet FYI) and installed an Intel NVMe 250GB drive that I already had here from my last computer. The only down side is that the boot options do not allow you to specify WHICH boot drive you will boot to first in the options. I had to wipe the original 1TB drive first and then it would boot to my SSD. There is only room for a 9.5 MM thick drive, so anything thicker in size will not fit, in case anyone is wondering. \r\n\r\nIt did come with 8GB of DDR4 ram. But unlike some of the other brands and models being released, this one has TWO DDR4 memory expansion slots on the motherboard so upgrading to 16, and possibly 32GB of ram is an option. I have not tested 32GB of ram on it since my budget is limited. but as soon as I can afford to get it, I will. This computer came with a single 8GB chip in it, in case anyone is wondering. Some companies like to put several older chips in to total the advertised amount. \r\n\r\nThe one BIG down side is the graphics performance. It only managed a 25FPS score on Cenebench. Honestly, for VEGA graphics, I would have hoped for at least 30 to 35 FPS. With it being a budget laptop, overclocking is not an option. While I do like to play games occasionally, the one I play the most uses an Android emulator (MEmu). So most of those games will peak out at 30 FPS anyways. I have not done any testing with that as of yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cooling fan does tend to get a bit loud when it gets to running hard trying to cool the laptop, so make sure you keep it where it can breathe easily. Sitting it where the air intake is restricted will result in a MUCH shorter life cycle. \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, for a very budget laptop ($309.99 plus taxes on sale), I feel I got my money's worth, and would definitely give it 4 of 5 stars for a score, with the last star being held back because of the graphics. this is a very nice laptop and it is going to be around for a while."", ""I bought this on sale at my local Best Buy for $349.99, alongside a Samsung 970 EVO M.2 SSD for $99.99. After tax, this set me back $488.75.

I dropped off both items at Geek Squad after informing the agent that I wanted the SSD installed, the mechanical hard drive wiped, and Windows 10 set up with the SSD marked as the boot drive. I signed some paperwork and I came back a couple of hours later when the Best Buy Home app notified me that my work was completed.

6339173 ,"(""Been waiting for this refresh since AMDs announcement of the 2nd gen Ryzen processors in January. Although this 3700U processor is only about 5% faster than it's predecessor, the 2700U, the main selling point here is the die shrinkage from 14nm to 12nm. This means less power consumption, less heat and better overall CPU efficiency. I had the previous model, the 15M-CP0012DX, and I can tell you that this new model runs much quieter and cooler. CPU temps while streaming and browsing, which is my main use, seem to be roughly 3-5 °C cooler. Idle is at 35 °C. This new model still uses the same keyboard, same ram frequency at 2400, same Realtek WiFi card (which is now inaccessible unless you remove the mother board) and same FHD IPS touch display so I won't talk about those. One thing to note about the display and one of my only gripes, it's still a bit dim just like the previous one, I was hoping HP gave it some more brightness but they didn't. Since it only came with 8GB of ram, I took the liberty to open the back cover up and upgrade it to 32GB of ram. I just don't think 8GB is enough these days and adding more ram takes a little less stress off of the CPU which helps it run even cooler. I noticed the back cover was redesigned for better airflow and there are much more thermal tapes scattered around. Internal design is a big upgrade from the 2700U model. There are now 2 cooling fans with even more heat pipes, seems like HP is taking fan noise and heat very serious and that's something I can appreciate. Also, there is only 1 drive for the PCI-e NVMe SSD, no more SATA III drive which is fine by me. Laptop comes with 256GB which is fine for most people but if you want to upgrade they make them up to 2TB (4000GB), if you have the means to buy one. I can't comment on battery life too much as I mostly keep my laptop in my room and plugged in but it seems to last a decent amount of time of around 4-5 hours. I ran it unplugged on purpose and it wasn't too bad at all although I don't have solid figures. Maybe another review will address this. So overall I am very happy with this laptop, no issues at all so far. That's all I have and thanks for reading. Hopefully this will help you decide to buy or not."", ""I got this laptop for regular home use. It works fantastic, it's super responsive, and beautiful.

This is a touchscreen even though the specs currently say it's not (I knew it would be because I was able to find the HP spec sheet online, but in case you're wondering). A few things worth mentioning, there is no indicator on the num lock key to indicate if it is on or off, there is no f lock key, and the fingerprint reader is hit or miss. None of these things were deal breakers for me nor do I feel like they were things that I personally would remove a star for.

Still nice, feels nice and the build looks pretty decent and more premium. It\'s just been 2 weeks so can\'t talk in terms of longevity. First thing i did was swap the parts that I could and install windows 10 with an ISO from Microsoft direct. Now about the upgrades, HP seems keen to hide info probably to sell the highest specs or maybe make a bank later when you go back to them for upgrades. But the m.2 and the RAM can easily be upgraded, few screws and the ram shield. I ended up with the 3700u with the 8gb ram and 256 m.2 (2280 size) 15M-DS0012DX model to be precise. Considering maxing out was the same cost of buying after market parts; in fact it would be cheaper if you were to say sell the original parts. So I ended up with a 2x8gb PNY sticks (16 total, I\'ve been told by oner user the system can handle 64gb (he confirmed this by actually jamming gb in) although the manufacturer recommed 32 - same mentioned on the curicial site but oddly only option you get from the HP site max is 16) and the samsung 500gb 970 evo plus 970. Using Samsung magician; Sequential Read: 3374, write 2591, random (iops): read 172,363, write 76,171. It came with a SKhynix 256GB HFM256GDJTNG and 2x4gb SK hynix 2666 speed ram sticks (Probably getting rid of old stock because the laptop only supports 2400 max). Not sure if all laptops would come with the same innards. Only time I heard the fans were pretty much while playing unreal tournament (nothing else i did was heavy yet) else doing chrome and movies etc it was rather quiet with a max 2-3 second fan and back to normal. The game ran pretty smooth, i think I played for an hour and no issues, no feel of throttling but then the game isn\'t demanding I guess , it\'s the only game I play so it\'s nice i have a portable option for it. I had 12 chrome tabs, the game on and the laptop was less thatn 50% CPU usage and ram usage less than 8GB. Also some configs include the HP tilt pen, so keep an eye for that if you don\'t need it, it seems they will charge you another 50 usd or so on it. One thing I hated but it seems with all new laptops, there\'s no proper standby sleep mode, it goes into this modern sleep mode which just eats batter unlike the true s3 mode. The moden standby keeps network connection alive and although low power, not enough . I hope we get it in some update because it\'s rather stupid not to have such a old option. Keybord backlight would be needed often it seems as the print on the keys and keyboard color makes it difficult to see under certain light. I liked how they conceal the screws under the rubber grip strip under the laptop. Using it to read books etc as tablet is not really ideal because it\'s heavy to treat it like a book, but if you don\'t care about your posture and doing a couch lay, it\'s pretty neat with portrait mode browsing against your stomach and your lap I suppose.. Light color bleeding on the screen, something most devices have, so no biggie I think. Beautiful design and feels really nice, everyone who saw it in person loved it. The bang and olufsen is just a smart marketing ploy, speakers are really good but they are basically """"custom-tuned in collaboration with bang and olufsen"""", so yeah marketing. Played some mudvayne heavy stuff and did not get that annoying distortion but I think it could be better; it has some special settings for the speakers in the software. Power and sleep settings seems limited, i don\'t see a lot of the options I have on Intel laptops and windows pro, so I don\'t know if its because of that or maybe in some update we would see some extra stuff. Night light doesn\'t work at the moment, maybe because of the latest Windows update, seen some people with the 2500u and 3500u saying the same, you can configure it through the Radeon settings though. Fingerprint works great. Tapping the screen does make the screen shake a little, I think it\'s normal and doesn\'t bother me; but then I don\'t use the touchscreen exclusive but in more of a combination at times. Keybaord feels pretty nice, took me a few seconds to get used to it, just because it has a number-pad, you would basically not be in the center but that\'s what you get for wanting a number-pad. Touchpad is nice, gesture supports are sweet and configurable, helps work faster; can be found under touchpad settings. Battery is also easily removable if you would prefer it to be a connected device always, disconnecting the battery could prolong it\'s life I suppose.', ""Ryzen 7, expandable RAM to 32GB, Vega Graphics, lightweight, and metal.

It doesn\'t come with a digital pen/stylus. But these are cons one can live with. It\'s a well intentioned laptop. The solid state drive is very fast to boot up. There\'s no lag in the processor or the graphics. There are no hiccups. BU-BU-BU-BUT!!! This laptop cannot stay connected to wireless internet (WAN). One of the most important features of the most base PC\'S is wireless connectivity.\r\n\r\nFortunately for me I\'m in IT right? I can fix this right? I\'m not the average end user right? WRONG! After at least 8, count them, 8 hours that I\'ll not get back, the issue was unresolved. I updated all necessary software from Microsoft updates to the actual WAN drivers. I made sure my firmware was up to date on my router. I refreshed windows 10 to a fresh start and went through the steps again. I reset the network. It actually worked for a few hours and then Microsoft One Drive started synching and blamo, back to the SNAFU. \r\n\r\nIt finally came down to me having to buy a USB ethernet dongle to determine whether or not the problem was hardware or software. I balked at the idea of having to do more leg work for a brand new, out of the box laptop/tablet. I\'ll bet a dollar to a donut it\'s still a software issue, but whose? Microsoft, HP, the motherboard manufacturer that houses the chipset for the WAN? Basically the next steps were the dongle test and then a thumb drive to flash/update the BIOS of the brand new laptop. \r\n\r\nAre your eyes glazed over yet? Have you started beating yourself over the head with whatever device your reading this from? Do you feel overwhelmed? Well this will be your buying experience. The only ENVY you\'ll feel is for someone with a laptop with useable internet.\r\n\r\nUpon returning the item the assistant manager didn\'t want to take it back. He wanted to exchange it for another one. Yes, let\'s do trade one useless $700 brick for another one. I stuck to my guns and told him I had fifteen days to return. They said I only had 14 days. Luckily it was day 14. But still he persisted. Mangers need to remember what it\'s like to be a customer as I am sure they buy crappy, expensive things as well. So I bored him with the same details like I did you and got my money back eventually. But he did put me into an anger state for the better half of a day upon leaving the store, like they won\'t just re-sell it to some other schmuck or write it off. What happened to customer service? Why must we be out into an anger state just to return stuff? Just a week prior I had dropped a chunk of change on a 4K TV and sound bar there. All I can say to this experience is, ""Hello Nebraska Furniture Mart."" I\'ll never set foot in BB again.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is a normal end-user should not be expected to handle all this. Not even with the help of HP tech support. New PCs should handle their business in a manner that is transparent to the user. This model is anything but. It is not robust. BB should adhere to a better standard of quality control. Stand behind what you sell, test it like Consumer Reports.

6350872 ,"('PROS:\r\n* GTX 1660 Ti\r\n* 8GB (2x 4GB) RAM to utilize dual-channel out of the box\r\n* Sturdy build/construction\r\n* No HDD to slow you down\r\n* Easy to get into the laptop for future upgrades\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n* No Windows Hello\r\n* 2 of the 3 USB Type-A ports are 2.0\r\n* Speakers are located under the laptop\r\n\r\n--Build Quality--\r\nThe 2019 Dell G3 is ""unapologetically plastic"", but without feeling cheap or flimsy. The chassis is very sturdy and the screen has very little flex to it. My only real complaint about going with the plastic build is with the wrist rest: it collects fingerprints and skin oil like it\'s its job (so keep a microfiber cloth in you backpack).\r\n\r\nThe keyboard isn\'t my favorite, but it\'s far from what I would consider to be a bad keyboard. It\'s comfortable and accurate for gaming and I can comfortably use the keyboard for prolonged typing.\r\n\r\nThe display is a 60Hz IPS (1080p) display. It doesn\'t get super bright (so I would recommend avoiding working/playing near a window), but it still looks good. If you would prefer to use an external display, the G3 has a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port (supporting single 4k output) and an HDMI 2.0 port on the right side.\r\n\r\nThe G3 does have three USB Type-A ports, but only one is USB 3.1 (on the left), the other two are 2.0 ports. This isn\'t a big deal to me, since I usually prefer to use the right ports for my mouse and USB headphones (so 2.0 is just fine).\r\n\r\nI\'m rarely impressed with the speakers on laptops, and the G3 is no exception. The speakers are located on the bottom sides of the laptop, rather than facing you. The speaker quality isn\'t that great either, especially when listening to music (bass is almost nonexistent).\r\n\r\n--Performance--\r\nDell has brought some of their Alienware features over to the G-line with the ""Alienware Command Center"" (to optimize the game settings based on your system) and a dedicated ""G-key"" which will max out the fan speed. Speaking of the fans: they get loud, very loud. I would HIGHLY recommend using a pair of gaming headphones with decent noise-isolation. The fans do a good job though, after a couple hours of gaming, the CPU+GPU were averaging in the mid to high 70s °C.\r\n\r\nHere\'s how the G3 held up in the games I play:\r\n - Overwatch (ultra settings): high 60s FPS\r\n - Fortnite (high settings, with view distance on epic): high 50s FPS\r\n - Witcher 3 (mix of high and medium settings): high 50s FPS\r\n - World of Warcraft (ultra and high settings, in raids): high 40s to low 50s FPS\r\n - Guild Wars 2 (using auto-detect settings, in populated areas): mid 50s FPS\r\n\r\n--Overall--\r\nThe focus of the G3 is to allow gamers to get a decent 1080p gaming laptop without breaking the bank. Dell focused on game performance over everything else. It doesn\'t have a premium feel, still uses USB Type-A 2.0 ports, ""only"" has a 1080p IPS display, but none of those really take away from the gaming experience. All of my games run quite smooth and I have no issues with gaming on the G3 for multiple hours. A gaming laptop at this price point with a GTX 1660 Ti is a great value.', 'I was excited to get this laptop as it was my first gaming laptop. In my experience, Dell has been a very reliable brand and generally gives you good quality on a budget. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Backlit keyboard - love the blue color\r\n-Great processing speeds\r\n-HD graphics which looked amazing while streaming movies and shows\r\n-NO GLARE on the screen\r\n-Number pad was included in this layout\r\n-Overall great performance\r\n-Worked really well with games like Fallout 4 \r\n-Battery life is awesome. I was able to play for 3-4 hours without issue. \r\n-Looks cool. I really like the design of the laptop in general.\r\n\r\nNow for the cons:\r\n-The power button is hard to press for some reason, not a deal breaker, but certainly noticable\r\n-I had issues running some lower video quality games. Got a lot of stuttering while running games like What Remains of Edith Finch which doesn\'t really require much to run. I tested a few other lower video quality games and for some reason, it struggled. But to be honest, you buy a gaming laptop to run high quality games on it, so it\'s once again not a deal breaker. \r\n-If you aren\'t using headphones or a headset, the sound can get a little boxy and you can hear a slight rattling.\r\n-The fans are LOUD especially when you turn on the Alienware Performance Mode. Though it\'s a cool feature, I suggest headphones because it does get really loud.\r\n-It\'s heavy for a 15"" laptop. I believe it weighed in at 6 pounds which is a bit hefty, but not impossible to carry around. \r\n\r\nOverall I really like this laptop. I think Dell produced a very powerful laptop for a very reasonable price.', 'So last year’s G3 was decent but nothing too impressive. Dell stepped up and “redesigned from the ground up.” They really changed everything from the chassis to the hardware and I gotta say I am impressed.\r\n\r\nThis model comes with the 9th Gen Intel Core i5 with 8GB RAM and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti. Not bad at all. However, the 2019 model is anything but a spec refresh. This shows on the design which was overhauled. It really is much sleeker than the previous model. It is noticeably slimmer and lighter. It’s not light by any means, coming in at 6 pounds. I would still say it is more “portable” than its ancestors. This comes with a 512 GB SSD. You can easily take out the bottom panel and also add a HDD which is very nice. RAM is also upgradeable. \r\n\r\nBuild quality is solid. The chassis is plastic. There is no keyboard or screen flex. The coating that they used can be a bit of a fingerprint magnet so I would keep a wipe handy. \r\n\r\nI have the Eclipse Black colorway. The keyboard is black with blue keys and accents. It does feel a bit mushy to type on. They have good travel and ok feedback otherwise. I did have very mild trouble with a sticky shift key, but other than that no major complaints. This model has blue backlighting which I feel can be fatiguing on the eyes. It is not customizable but I believe that the higher spec models have customizable RGB backlighting if that is important to you. The trackpad is ok. I doubt you will be using it much if you bought it for mainly gaming. \r\n\r\nSpeakers can get decently loud and crispy but they do sound a bit tinny and buzzy at higher volumes. They are located on the sides and are kind of bottom firing which is not ideal. They are definitely good enough for media consumption but I would get headphones for gaming because of fan noise when running Game Shift (see below).\r\n\r\nThe display is decent. It is a 60 Hz FHD IPS panel. It comes in at 250 nits of brightness which does well indoors. Pictures do look sharp although not very color accurate. I would say that the display will not blow you away but its perfectly ok for gaming basic titles. You can get a brighter 300 nits screen and 144 Hz panel with the higher spec models. The bezels are much thinner and aesthetically pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe G3 has a decent selection of ports. This year it actually comes with a USB Type-C port! It also has a headphone jack, Ethernet jack, USB 3.1, HDMI 2.0, and a power port on the left. It has two USB 2.0 and a SD card reader on the right. \r\n\r\nBattery life was around 4 hours on a full charge with max brightness and casual internet browsing. It’s respectable and middle of the pack. \r\n\r\nPerformance. The most important thing. First off, Dell has added something called Game Shift to the software. It is a button (F7) that you can press that quickly allows for a boost in performance. They also threw in the Alienware Command Centre which allows for fine-tuning of CPU, GPU, fan speeds, and so on. The graphics card is a Max-Q version of the 1660 Ti. While it is true that the performance lags behind the 1660 Ti, the Max-Q versions allow for thinner, quieter, and lighter GPUs which can fit in these thin chassis. When you press Game Shift, there is a very noticeable and audible increase in fan speed. This is important because this thing can really play games. It has no problems running games on high graphics. It was running Dead by Daylight at over 100 fps. It is limited by the frame rates but at the very least, there is no lag. \r\n\r\nAll in all, it is a very good and capable laptop with no big flaws.', 'The G3 is a mid-tier gaming platform. They primarily focused on providing performance to pricing limbo!! And I think they succeeded\r\n\r\nThe laptop at the time of release was just over the 1K price point. Leading with an i5 CPU//8GB RAM/512SSD drive paired to a 15.3"" 1080 screen. It has all your expected connection ports and a full keyboard(includes numeric pad).\r\n\r\nThe shell although is plastic but is very sturdy and has limited flex.\r\n\r\nI was able to put this through its paces as both a gaming platform and for work running Wireshark traces and other networking tools. It handled all tasks well with no issues.\r\n\r\nI really like the black and blue styling and the rubber feet on the bottom to keep everything in place during use. Especially in those critical gaming moments when you exert more force than normal!! \r\n\r\nI only knocked down the score to a 4 for the following reasons:\r\n1. The audio was lacking volume (speakers on bottom)- will definitely want a set of headphones with this rig - I paired with the Astro A50 4th Gen\r\n2. The power brick is HUGE!! \r\n3. Power plug in is the typical half inch circle plug that comes out the side and sticks out a solid 2"" - not mobile friendly\r\n4. for a Gaming machine a few programmable functions buttons on the keyboard would have been a nice touch for quick media controls - plenty of space for this\r\n5. Fan noise can be a bit excessive and a little loud if in a quiet environment\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall I was happy with this build and performance for the pricing point offered. Functions were on point with no lag from the machine.', 'Dell G3 is Dell\'s line of affordable gaming laptops.\r\n\r\nThis new 2019 model gets the basics down with a few compromises for a great price\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\nA bit bulky, and over 5 Lb., in an all-plastic case, with a bit of flair with blue accents and angled back, it\'s built to handle the actual heat from the CPU and GPU.\r\nThe keyboard is full-size island keys, including numeric keypad, with adjustable intensity blue backlighting. The trackpad is large enough, slightly to the left so it\'s centered below the space key.\r\nThe laptop comes with a very large (And heavy) power supply, rated at 180W (Which would be needed to run the CPU and GPU at full).\r\nThe laptop has an internal 3-Cell 51W battery.\r\nI couldn\'t remove the bottom cover because it has a hidden screw behind the label, but from what I found, the memory and SSD are replaceable, and there is also an internal, empty 2.5"" HDD bay.\r\n\r\nScreen:\r\nSpecs: 1920x1080 60Hz, 15.6"", 6-bit depth. Matte screen, no touchscreen\r\nWhile the specs don\'t sound that impressive, in person it\'s actually very pleasant. The images are clear, and the matte screen is best to avoid glare, and workable angle views.\r\n\r\nCPU / Memory / Drive:\r\n9th Generation (2019) Intel i5-9300H with four cores, Embedded 630 Display controller.\r\n8 Gb DDR4 in two slots: 4 Gb / slot. Note that while the memory would need to be replaced to expand it, it performs better when distributed in two slots rather than single 8 Gb slot.\r\n512 Gb M2 NVMe: This is a nice, fast drive. Larger drives tend to perform better because data is more distributed through memory blocks.\r\n\r\nVideo: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (Max-Q)\r\n\r\nSlots/Connections:\r\n - On the right, two USB 2.0 (Yes, 2.0), SD card reader.\r\n - On the left: Barrel-type power cord, One USB-C (DisplayPort), One HDMI 2.0, One USB 3.1, Ethernet RJ45, headphone jack\r\nA bit disappointed that it has no thunderbolt ports (So no eGPUs here), and only one USB-C that\'s also the DisplayPort. And one USB 3.1 while two other ports are USB 2.0 (Fine for keyboard and mouse), but would use one of the USB 3.1 or USB-C for a memory stick.\r\n\r\nThere is a camera above the screen but with no depth sensor and no fingerprint sensor, so no option for Windows Hello.\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\nNot much bloat, thankfully, except for McAfee (one-year free subscription), Spotify, Netflix, and Office (trial).\r\nThe antivirus didn\'t pose much resistance when uninstalling, and Windows went back to Windows Defender smoothly.\r\nThen there are the typical bunch of programs from dell for software upgrades and cleanup, Nvidia tools and pleasantly surprised that it also includes the Alienware control center.\r\nThe keyboard has a ""G"" key (Actually, F7) that enabled the performance mode with fans at full speed via the Alienware control center.\r\n\r\nBenchmark (With default settings)\r\nGeekBench 4\r\nSingle-Core: 4960\r\nMulti-Core: 16704\r\nOpenCL: 187427\r\n\r\nGames:\r\nFortnite runs smoothly at 60 FPS at \'Epic\' quality\r\n\r\nVR:\r\nIt can run the new Oculus Rift S. The GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is listed as recommended. Note that The Rift S uses both the USB 3.1 port and the USB-C port, and you\'ll need an (inexpensive) USB-C to DisplayPort adapter.\r\n\r\nResuming:\r\nCurrent-generation CPU. Overall package is nice, except for not having enough ports and no Thunderbolt. While the screen is rather basic, is pleasant to look at, with solid colors. The Ti 1660 video card is actually pretty good for the value on this machine, which is the main reason one would get this.', ""Dell has come up with a nice option for gamers that are looking for an affordable laptop with decent specs. The chassis is sleek and elegant looking which is a nice change from the gaudy, overstated look of many gaming laptops. Build construction seems to be quite nice and should withstand typical laptop movement, packing and use. \r\n\r\nThe 9th Gen I5 processor was more than adequate and it's great to have the GTX 1660 Ti graphics card. The G3 was used on a variety of games and the results were smooth with no hiccups. Fan noise was acceptable, but perhaps some that don't use headsets may find the fan noise more noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe anti-glare 1920 x 1080 screen looks good with nice color and clarity. The lack of a touch screen seems logical given this laptop is primarily for gamers. There is a built-in webcam and microphone. The 512GB SSD offers nice data access and start up speeds over a hard drive option.\r\n\r\nThis laptop also features two tuned speakers that deliver adequate 3D audio for gamers. The keyboard is backlit and has a 10-key numeric keypad which is a nice option for other applications. Wireless connectivity worked great. Laptop features plenty of ports that includes one USB 3.0 type C port.\r\n\r\nIf you're a gamer that is looking for laptop with a nice design, yet still portable, at a great price point to include a GTX 1660Ti graphics card, then this is a great option to consider. Just note that the G3 laptop does not include a touch screen or a dvd/cd drive, but that is not unusual for many laptops."", ""Thus far the laptop itself is excellent, I went ahead and upgraded the ram to 16GB and added a 2TB HDD for storage, no complaints with how easy it was for someone like me with very little experience to do this in an afternoon.

I went ahead and also uninstalled DellSupportAssist(I've read can also slow speed, but I did it as an extra precaution anyway). Quick google search confirmed this is an issue that affects Dell Computers with this program installed. \nWorks perfectly now, and at it's Black Friday price of 699$ instant steal! \n\n4 Stars only because SmartByte is absolutely awful and nobody should have to do detective work for a brand new laptop fresh out of the box.

This laptop suits pretty well without  breaking the bank for me, it can handles AAA games on medium settings at a constant 60 fps 1080p. I would consider this laptop as mid range.\n\nOne con is the laptop is hot when gaming. Fans needs to be set to max to keep the laptop cool (80c-85c), thus making a lot on noise. When normal use the temps is around 48c- 55c.\nAnother thing is I really didn't like the screen design. When open the heat exhaust collides with the screen obstructing the air way.\nWith the screen at 90 degree angle the air blows completely into a wall, at least beyond 90 degree the air flow can go up the screen like a ramp. I'm not sure how much of an impact this have on the temperature.\n\nThe dell G3 is a pretty decent laptop if you are not using the laptop as a primary gaming machine. It works for me on the go playing a few minutes at friend houses or out in public. I didn't mind the medium setting visuals.\n\nIf you are looking for a laptop as a primary gaming machine with high setting, high frame rates, better visuals then this laptop is not for you.

Typically I buy hardware that's a few years older so I can save some cash and since I'm not typically buying games day 1 when they come out, I don't find that my needs for performance are super high.  I imagine my habits are typical.  So my steam library is older, most of the game I play are from a few years back... all that to say the 1660ti performs HANDSOMELY on those titles.  So far I've been able to pretty much set everything to ultra without an issue.  I do play overwatch and I tone it down (just a hair) for that one to squeeze out some extra frames... but overall... this is a KILLER set up!

Has a 1660ti maxQ graphics card with 6 gigs of memory. It's not the full fat 1660ti, it's got a lower core clock and memory speed. The maxQ version was made to keep the heat down in thinner laptops. It performs closer to a 1060, but in the newer games it's faster. It performs well when plugged in, I am getting a average 60fps in asassains creed odyssey on high settings and146 fps average in sniper elite 3rd on ultra settings. When on battery it only can use the integrated graphics on the 9750H cpu, so forget about getting any playable frame rates, maybe in older games on 720p on the lowest settings.

6373032 ,"('The Dell Inspiron 15.6” 7000 2-in-1 is a great laptop featuring a sharp 4K display, a fast 512GB SSD with 32GB Optane memory, 16GB RAM, the latest 10th generation i7-10510U processor, and an MX250 GPU with dedicated 2GB of GDDR5. Everything you would want Dell has added to this powerhouse making it the perfect all around laptop for practically everyone (apart from serious PC gamers). On the outside there is a satin metallic black finish that gives it a clean look but attracts fingerprints. The left side has a traditional power port to charge the device with the included brick, a full size HDMI port, Thunderbolt 3/USB C, and micro SD slot. The right is flanked by two USB 3.1 ports and combination microphone/headphone jack. \r\n\r\nOpening the device reveals a colorful 4K display, a nested stylus stored magnetically in the hinge and a full size keyboard with a 10-key numeric pad. A few gripes here is the trackpad isn’t the best, my trackpad has some play/movement when pushed down before it clicks. On what otherwise is a solid device, the trackpad falls short. The small amount of play aside, tracking is good and scrolling is smooth. The keyboard makes up for my issue with the trackpad by offering fantastic typing feel. The keys have decent travel and offer great feedback without being noisy. The power button inside is also a fingerprint reader, which works well and is a convenient way to switch users. The stylus is battery operated and is a nice addition but I will primarily use this as a laptop as this is a less than ideal tablet. The display, while rich and colorful, has noticeable light bleed in the top corners of the screen. It is most apparent when waking the device as it briefly shows a black background, revealing a flaw that is otherwise obfuscated by colorful backgrounds and content. One of the key features of this device is the ability to fold the display all the way back, allowing it to be held and used like a tablet. Unfortunately the weight of the device and active cooling make this a poor tablet experience. Don’t get me wrong, it is a cool feature and some people may find it manageable but for most you will have a far better tablet experience with a different form factor. The fans are mostly silent except for when you try to run a graphically demanding game, which is to be expected. Don’t expect a gaming machine but you can play less graphically demanding games with the settings turned all the way down. For instance, I was able to navigate No Man’s Sky with everything turned off but it easily became overwhelmed during action sequences. Again this isn’t what this laptop is for but it gives you an idea of the performance it is capable of.\r\n\r\nBack to it’s strong points, I couldn’t be happier with this as a laptop. Of the 460GB storage partition, mine had 400GB available after running updates. The SSD recorded a blistering 2300 MB/s read and 1100MB/s write, likely due to the Intel Optane memory. Geekbench recorded 1266 single core and 4380 multicore on battery, which isn’t bad for a laptop. Arbitrary numbers aside, the laptop feels fast and I have been pleased with the performance. Battery life is pretty good as well. It can hold a charge for 4 or 5 days and still manage to get 5+ hours of battery life with mixed usage. Overall, it really is a great device. Dell has managed to provide something for everyone in a nicely packaged 2-in-1.', 'As purchased in this configuration, the Dell - Inspiron 7000, 2-in-1, 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD, Touch-Screen Laptop with its Intel Core i7, 16GB Memory, 512GB SSD is just about perfect for a broad range of users. Yes, that was all a mouthful, but a laptop buyer has so many decisions to make and this setup I’m using makes all the right decisions for you. These 2-in-1 models can be set on a desk or counter in “tent” mode, or laptop mode for standard typing, or reversed into “stand” mode for movie watching on a plane, or tablet mode with that neat digital pen when drawing or sketching, or just doodling. There’s even a magnetic pen holder depression in the hinge area so you will not lose that special pen.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful for readers to know that this is an August 2019 model Dell Insprion, loaded with changes and upgrades that separate it from previous models. \r\n\r\nThe Dell has the more desirable 16GB of memory and a nice compromise between price and storage capacity with its 512GB SSD, (Intel Optane with 32GB memory) (really fast and rugged) drive that loads software quickly.\r\n\r\nIt has a i7-10510U processor, 8MB cache (first available in August 2019, it’s Intel’s Comet Lake (CML-U)) which should result in performance improvements and better battery life. \r\n\r\nThe included Video adapter is a NVIDIA® GeForce® MX250 with 2GB GDDR5 graphics memory device driving Dell’s 15.6-inch UHD (3840 x 2160) Touch Display. More to the point, this is great video, with games, movies and music videos looking super. The sound output is very nice for a laptop, but most folks will probably use the headphone jack or output to a speaker array. There are tools for audio management provided by Dell.\r\n\r\nThere is now Intel WiFi ver.6 and Bluetooth 5 built in.\r\n\r\nThe previous USB-C port has been upgraded to Thunderbolt 3 which will manage power delivery and operate as a Display Port. [You’ll want to add a dock to exploit this very fast port. It’s how I added hard wired ethernet.] There is an HDMI 2.0 port here for that outboard monitor I have on my desktop. There is a 3-in-1 MicroSD card reader (also on the same Left side). No more hunting for adapters.\r\n\r\nThere are also 2 USB 3.1 Gen1 ports (right side of computer) along with a 3.5 mm Headphone/Microphone jack. It’s nice having these ports which accept my array of peripherals, again, without adapters. \r\n\r\nPower is provided by a barrel power cable attached to a 90 watt brick. The power-on is also a finger-print reader, but I didn’t test it. (I’m unwilling to trust any vendor’s barrier to accessing my computer.) \r\n\r\nThere is a tiny, but high quality 720p camera centered on the top of the display’s very narrow bezel. \r\n\r\nSETUP: Laughably easy. Even fun. I’ve never had a computer talk me through a setup and listen to my responses! What a kick! On those occasions where I went hunting on the track pad to select the right input, I had to remind myself to reach over and touch the screen. It’s a laptop . . . no . . . it’s a tablet . . no it’s either or both. Geesh. This is fun, and so much easier. Setup was crazy fast. I was ready to do my work before I expected. Very nice. \r\n\r\nERGONOMIC FEATURES: The backlit keyboard is very responsive and predictable. I liked the feel and how the keys are set back far enough so my palm rests comfortably on the expanded platform afforded by the 15” laptop. I was especially happy with the trackpad that was sensitive to movement and not fussy about the press-to-select function. And, of course, there’s that crazy tablet feature set. I hardly ever need to play with a trackpad when I can reach over and tap the screen. It stops being strange very quickly, until I’m forced back to another computer. It’s only when I’m foolishly reaching to touch a screen that ignores my touch, almost mocking my futile efforts that I want to return to my Dell 2-in-1. It’ll happen to you, too.\r\n\r\nWeight is no better than average for this size laptop, but this workhorse may not leave most user’s desktop. [Add a dock with a few more ports and the idea of a desktop computer no longer makes sense for me. I’ve been using laptops, only, for 2 decades.] The display feels especially big, but that’s probably because the bezel is very thin. Display quality is very nice. The Dell’s screen is sharp and colorful; I’m impressed. [Here again, I have a large desktop monitor attached to the HDMI port, so my photography and serious work is off loaded most of the time. Not a huge issue for me but the screen is a bit too glossy.] \r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE: I’m not going to offer any laboratory, controlled tests. You’ll need to look elsewhere for that. I can offer some observations useful to my type of user. I’m online with Gigabit Internet home service that I want to exploit for business and fun. I’ve got photo, music, movie and home control hobbies. I will travel on occasion. I’m not much of a game player, but I doubt the average play-for-fun game player is going to feel handcuffed with such a detailed 4k display and a fast SSD Drive delivering the action. Battery life and the Windows Ink technology enabled on this two-in-one touchscreen open another category of software applications for users like me to explore. Students who are never without their laptops are going to love the reasonable weight for all this capability. \r\n\r\nSUMMARY: I encourage family and friends to not “under buy” their laptops. The longer you are satisfied with your computer, the longer you’ll wait until your next purchase. This Dell makes few, if any compromises. Getting a computer loaded with the most useful features is how I reduce my computer costs. Meanwhile, I’m not envious of all those computers others have and I’m not suffering with poor performance. It’s not going to thrill hard core gamers. But they know to look at those graphic intensive laptops. Everyone else is going to be more than pleased for a number of years.', 'As a \'retired\' consultant, my jobs require lots of out of town road-trips.

My previous, 3 In 1, laptop/tablet (national brand) had two separate small hinges on either side of the screen base attached to the keyboard. The left hinge failed shortly after the warranty expired. I was surprised that the repair cost to replace one hinge was in excess of six hundred dollars, half of the cost of my year old, laptop/tablet. Yikes! It was still sort of usable, but would never stand-up, or close properly. I used an ordinary \'chip-clip\' to keep it together, but was an \'unhappy-camper\' after spending over a thousand dollars for it. So, when I had an opportunity to receive this Dell laptop in exchange for an honest review I was super excited. This Dell Inspiron 15.6"" 7000 2-in-1 4K UHD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB - GeForce MX250 - 512GB SSD + 32GB Optane, which has a substantial, solid, one piece hinge, is exactly what I needed. This feature-packed, power house laptop is now my portable office on the road. WooHoo!\r\n\r\nTaking it out of the box I was immediately impressed with its anodized aluminum build and finishes. The frame of this Dell housing around the Touch Screen is solidly built. It makes me believe that it will hold up easily in any mode I choose to put the unit in, over and over again. And, of course the rugged, one piece hinge is why I think this unit will last me a long time on the road. The screen will orientate itself in \'tent\', \'tablet\', \'movie\', and of course, laptop mode. On the road I use \'tablet\', \'tent\', and \'laptop\' mode the most. The 4K screen resolution is fantastic, with true-to-life details (important to me), and, brilliant colors. It is lightweight, weighs under five pounds, and I can easily carry it, or, pack it in my backpack for trips.\r\n\r\nWhy do I love this Dell Inspiron Convertible 2-in-1 Laptop?\r\n\r\n** Powerful Computing Process - This Intel 10th, Generation, Quad Core Processor, Model Number i7-10510U, operates at a base frequency of 1.80 GHz, supports Intel Optane Memory H10, 32GB, which allows for faster data transfer between the memory, storage, and the processor. I enjoy short boot times and fast applications set up. It remembers the programs that I use the most and opens them with amazing speed. The NVIDIA® GeForce® MX250 with 2GB GDDR5 graphics memory card enhances high-quality images for videos and photo editing, which is also important on my job. The 16GB of RAM allows me to multitask easily from my job notes, field schematics, and reports using the included digital pen. It is fantastic for my word processing, and job-related, photo notations too. YooHoo! Love this Dell.\r\n\r\n** Dell Active Pen - Fantastic tool for my consulting work. I can sketch prominent issues, concerns, and write annotations on my job notes, reports, and photos (see pics). I can simply take photos from my smart phone and download to this Dell Laptop by Bluetooth and make field notations on the pics..Outstanding! The pen also fits magnetically into the well designed into the Dell hinge. The Pen is powered by one 4-A battery. The Pen has numerous features and settings that I have really enjoyed exploring. It turns this powerful laptop into an invaluable, Job Accessory for me. This tool makes me so much more effective as I can now make field notations on existing drawings, illustrate problems, the need for more information, and correct my field notes and reports (see pics). YaHoo!\r\n\r\n** Keyboard – This Dell Inspiron features a super-useful, backlit keyboard with a numeric keypad. Love the addition of the numeric keypad for work on my spreadsheets. It also features an indiscreet ON switch, which is also a finger print reader for the ultimate in security. How cool is that? Please be aware that this Dell laptop will power OFF when it is closed, and, power back ON when opened.\r\n\r\n** Two In One Design – The 360° flip-and-fold design of this Dell, effectually makes this unit into a Four In One,\'Tent\', Tablet\', \'Stand-Up\', and, or, \'Laptop\'. Its strong, wide hinge makes this possible for years to come. I can easily switch into \'tablet\' mode, which is \'touch-screen\' friendly from any mode. \r\n\r\n** Ports & Jacks – This Dell laptop has two USB 3.1 ports on the Right Side of the unit along with a 3.5mm headphone or auxiliary audio, microphone jack, or audio output jack to external speakers. On the Left Side of the unit is the power/charge port, HDMI 2.0 output jack, a Type \'C\' DP/Power Delivery jack, which is a Thunderbolt Port for quicker for data transfer rates and storage, and a Micro SD Card Reader\r\n\r\n** Other Spectacular Features – It has a webcam at the very top and center of the screen. What I noticed using the webcam for a Skype Call is that it worked exceptionally well in low-light conditions, and the sound was clear on the other end. It also features the latest Wi-Fi 6, which very few routers are capable of accommodating, now. However, it actually \'future-proofs\' this Dell laptop as many newer devices and routers eventually will be equipped for Wi-Fi 6. It is also has Bluetooth along with the latest MS Windows 10. This Dell has a 30-day, Free Trial offer for Microsoft Office. This Dell includes a 90 Watt Brick Power Adapter, which provides a faster charge to approximately 80% in just one hour of charging. Four cell, Lithium-ion battery, which lasts me approximately four hours. Battery longevity depends on individual uses, of course. IMHO - I would prefer a 6 cell battery and 2K screen for much longer battery usage since the 4K uses much of the battery\'s power. This Dell is energy-star certified and has a one year warranty. Audio is pretty good for this small unit, but I use auxiliary BT speakers to enhance the sound quality.\r\n \r\nIn summary I highly recommend this Dell Inspiration 15.6"" 7000 2-in-1 4K UHD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB - GeForce MX250 - 512GB SSD + 32GB Optane. The Dell folks claim the base and lid of this unit has been tested for tens of thousands of openings and closings. It is ruggedly built and, I believe them (one of my major concerns). This Dell laptop is amazingly fast and versatile for me to use on the road. I love the Dell Pen, and, what it allows me to do. If you do any word processing, editing, free-hand sketches or drawings, this Pen is an invaluable tool. This laptop with its superior computing power, feature-packed technology, and versatility is worth every penny. . . .', 'I have several 32-bit non-subscription “pro” apps + monitor calibrating hardware I want to continue using and I’m at the end of the road with Mojave. I’m using this Dell to migrate workflow over to Win10 going forward vs investing in new calibration hardware and subscriptionware.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple quirks but overall this laptop is great. The i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD storage and GeForce MX250 2GB graphics on this Dell don’t feel like a compromise like our first two Win10 touch screens. I’ll still rely on external storage and “clouds” but 512GB is plenty for my installed software. The battery life on this Dell is impressive and it charges quickly. The laptop is silent most of the time. Some tasks will kick on the fan and make some noise, but it settles down quickly. This Dell is much quieter than our 13” HP 2 in 1 and stays much cooler. It can get warm but never uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe included active-pen has a storage slot within the hinge. A magnet within the pen holds it secure, yet it is easy to remove with one fingertip when the laptop is open to any position. The pen is locked in place when the laptop is closed. Including the pen + storage is a great feature. I use it more because it is right there. I spent $40 on a bamboo ink stylus for our other 2 in 1 and there is no on-board storage, so it mostly stays unused in the laptop sleeve side pocket.\r\n\r\nI really like having the numberpad on the 101 keyboard. The backlight can be cycled between off, low and high and will time out after several seconds. The glare spilling out from under the keys is minimal and only from a low angle.\r\n\r\nThe location of the touchpad is strange. It is centered on the spacebar of the QWERTY side of the keyboard, almost completely on the left half of the laptop. After 25+ years of reaching for a touchpad in the center of a laptop, I do so without thinking so my fingers keep coming in contact with the right side of the touchpad and I run out of space. If I reach too low my touch is registered as a right-click, so I disabled the lower right corner setting within windows. It is most awkward while using the laptop in my lap. Either I keep the laptop off balance to the right side of my lap or keep reaching further than necessary with my right hand instead of a simple reach of the fingers. This matters less when used on top of a desk and not at all in tablet, stand or tent mode.\r\n\r\nI’m really glad the right side has two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports. Nice they included a headphone jack since some folks still use those.\r\n\r\nThe left side has the power adapter port near the hinge, a barrel plug. Dell includes a standard two-part cord with brick in the middle. I notice this one can get very warm. There is a power/battery status light next to the power port. Next is the HDMI port, Thunderbolt 3 port with 5V power output (USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, Display Port 1.4) and a MicroSD card slot.\r\n\r\nThe left and right speakers are on the outside/bottom of the keyboard half. They make stereo sound, but the quality slightly depends on desktop/stand, tent or tablet mode. I’ll use Bluetooth for audio whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThe fingerprint reader is on top of the power button masquerading as the top right keyboard key with no backlight. Fingerprint scanners are nice to use with Windows Hello, but this Dell fails to read my fingerprint often, enough to be annoying. Probably because they don’t make phones, seriously. If you use the fingerprint scanner on a recent flagship phone, don’t expect the same performance. I’ve removed and added my fingerprints several times to make sure. Our first laptop with a fingerprint scanner is 1 ½ years old (Matebook X Pro) and ONE press of the power button from off, scans our print and logs us into windows within 8 seconds without fail.\r\n\r\nThe Dell needs one press to power up and another touch to scan your print and log into windows -assuming it recognizes your fingerprint on the first try. Sometimes it requires several attempts. Occasionally windows finally requires my PIN.\r\n\r\nThe laptop starts up when you open the hinge, so it feels like less time because it is ready to scan your print shortly after opening which requires only one touch. If you leave it open but powered off, you will need to press the button once to power up and then touch it again to scan your finger.\r\n\r\nThe corners on the bottom inside edge of the display near the hinge are very pointy on the inside edge. They dig into bare thighs in laptop configuration. I cradle these modern laptops near the hinge since the top and bottom halves are closely balanced, so I feel those sharp corners in my palms as well. Rounding off that inside edge some more would have made a world of difference. They are less noticeable in tablet mode and I don’t notice at all when using on a desktop or in stand or tent modes.', 'Bought the pc Tuesday night. Start using next day with the normal office works and in less than 24 hrs. shuts down twice for no reason while I am using web browser and excel/word. After rebooting on its own, window will show ""No bootable devices were found! Possible causes could be a corrupt OS image or a boot device is not enabled in BIOS set-up."" Run the dell assist app and indicates no issue. Worried but still didn\'t panic.\n\nHere comes Friday while trying to catch up with all office works...boom! Shuts down again by itself. Reboot just as the 1st 2 shut downs and voila! still the same message appeared. \n\nSo in less than 72 hrs. headed back to return. Not going to risk anymore.', 'REVIEW: Dell - Inspiron 2-in-1 15.6"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Black\r\nBEST BUY Tech Insider Network\r\n\r\nA WORTHY REPLACEMENT / UPGRADE TO MY 3 YEAR OLD 2:1\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: \r\nA solid overall performer with the benefit of 4K, SSD, and Touch Screen. This would be an ideal College Student computer for taking notes (especially with the included pen), causal but good enough gaming, graphics editing, etc. It is very solid and well built, (but also heavy). I have run it nearly 3 days with casual couch surfing without recharge and still have 30% battery life.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing a laptop you really have to be in tune with your needs and usage. This is not a full on gaming system (though it can handle most games at a lower frame rate). This is not a tiny light weight couch surfing system (it is pretty heavy at nearly 5 lbs). It is very rugged and should perform well for a long time. \r\n\r\nIt is an excellent all around computer that would satisfy most anyone’s everyday needs.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nTo start with, I’m coming from an almost identical (but 3 year older) 2 in 1 laptop from another mfg. This means I can really do a 1:1 comparison as all the specs are the same (I7, 4K Touch Screen, SSD, 16GB RAM, discrete Nvidia Graphics). The raw benchmarks should make this system about 2X faster all around based on CPU and Video Benchmarks vs a comparable 3 year old system.\r\n\r\nMY UTILIZATION\r\n60% Surfing / shopping on the web while watching TV (on a separate TV)\r\n10% Games on the road when traveling for business (vs dedicated desktop rig)\r\n10% Paying Bills, Emails, other similar tasks\r\n10% Watching Movies on the Plane / Hotel / On the Road\r\n10% Organizing and editing family photos / videos\r\n\r\nIt is probably a little overkill for daily use, but it is nice to have the power boost when needed for occasional games or graphic intensive tasks (photo / video processing). Though I use the touch screen extensively, I don’t often use it in pure tablet mode. The pen is a nice touch when needed.\r\n\r\nUNBOXING:\r\nINITIAL IMPRESSIONS:\r\nSimple, streamlined packaging\r\nMinimal bloatware that is easily removed – Anti Virus, Drop Box and Few from Microsoft.\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE:\r\nAs expected, the performance was nearly double my nearly identical 3 year old system. The disk speed was significantly faster (see pics). \r\n\r\nThe screen colors are better (see pics) and there is less bleeding from the edge backlights, but still noticeable on a completely black screen.\r\n\r\nWORTH THE UPGRADE?\r\n\r\nI guess it depends what system you are coming from and what you are trying to accomplish. This Dell packs a lot of power into a thin profile, and certainly feels faster than my identical 3 year old system. This only makes sense since it is comparing 10th gen I7 to 7th gen I7. \r\n\r\nI would say it makes sense to upgrade to this from anything 3 or more years old. Especially if you did not previously have SSD / 4K or, if you needed / wanted USB-C. What puts this over the top for me, besides overall performance, is the better 4K screen and having (3) total USB ports.\r\n\r\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone in the market for a 2:1 laptop. \r\nFor example, this is a fantastic higher end college student laptop that should last for years (consider accident protection for rough student use). I find pens great for taking notes during lectures. It does everything very well, and even plays most games at a “good enough to get by” frame rate. It won’t replace a full on gaming rig, but it is not supposed to either. It has 4K discrete graphics, the latest official USB-C standard, and a super fast SSD drive + 16GB RAM. \r\nIt would have been nice if it included a full version of MS Office instead of a trial version.\r\n\r\nCAUTION: MS WINDOWS UPDATE ISSUE NOT DELL (AS FAR AS I KNOW)\r\nAs of the date of this review Oct 21, 2019, Once I updated everything by running the Dell and MS updates over and over, My WiFi performance dropped from nearly 300Mbps to 6Mbps. I tried everything I could think of (uninstalled network drivers, getting new drivers from MS or Dell or Intel, some MS blogs and things to try DNS cache etc), in the end I had to do a FACTORY RESET to get my performance back up where it should be. Hopefully I can delay updates until a fix is found. On other laptops I was able to get around this by using an external WiFi dongle, but in this case it was also throttled down to 6Mbps. I’ve seen reports for the past year or so about Windows Update and WiFi issues, but until now it has not impacted me.', '1. The sound when it turns on was distorted from the start\n2. It keeps shutting down randomly and making a large beep sound (which is terrible when I\'m in class and it keeps beeping and I cant do anything about it let alone take notes) and I tried the fixes suggested below (cause someone else had the same exact problem) and suggestions in forums after I Googled ""no bootable devices found"" and it still continued to do this\n3. I spent so much time transferring stuff and trying to fix this problem but it still is broken. It only wasted my time and money. I\'m going to return it but I still lost all that time of me trying to set it up and it shutting down on my homework and me losing my progress', '')"
6299820 ,"('[[ Build and Exterior ]]\r\n\r\nProbably one of the first things you\'ll notice about this Chromebook is that it is somewhat thick. It definitely does not fall into the ultra-book category, but the aluminum exterior makes this unit feel very sturdy and durable.\r\n\r\nThe Chromebook does seem oddly heavy, so I can\'t see myself using it in tablet mode (keyboard folded behind the screen) for long periods of time.\r\n\r\nOn the outside of the unit are 2 USB Type-C port on either side of the laptop, a USB 3.0 port and headset jack on the left side and a Micro SD card slot on the right side. On the bottom is a built-in holder for the included stylus. The keyboard is also backlit, which makes late night typing much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[ Display ]]\r\n\r\nThe 14-inch display is ample without making the Chromebook overly large. Colors are sharp and the IPS display looks great from different angles. However, the screen is shiny and will definitely show glare from any light behind you, which is something to keep in mind if you plan to use this Chromebook outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe display is a touchscreen, so you can use it for interacting with apps, or using the included stylus for drawing. The display also rotates all the way back, so you can hold the Chromebook in tablet mode or prop it up in ""tent"" mode for movie watching.\r\n\r\nVideo playback, such as Netflix, looks great and playback is smooth, making this machine perfect for loading up offline Netflix shows for a long plane ride.\r\n\r\n[[ Performance ]]\r\n\r\nThe i3 processor definitely makes a difference in the general ""snappiness"" of the machine. Opening tabs and web pages is fast and responsive. The unit also includes 4GB of RAM which some might consider too low for a Windows 10-based machine, but seems to be just fine with Chrome OS. I had 10 websites open on different tabs with a YouTube video playing in the background and the machine was still performing great.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Google Play store, you can also install many Android games on the Chromebook. I tested out Asphalt 8 and the graphics looked incredible with very minimal stutter.\r\n\r\nUsing Geekbench 4 Android app running on this Chromebook, it scored a 4490 single-core score and 9208 multi-core score. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has a single-core score of 1960 and a multi-core score of 6472.\r\n\r\n[[ Battery Life ]]\r\n\r\nDell states that this unit can run 10 hours on a single charge, and after 5 hours of web browsing, I still had about 60% of the battery remaining, so the 10 hour claim seems to be accurate.\r\n\r\nI\'ve found that I\'m able to recharge the Dell Chromebook with many ""Power Delivery"" chargers, such as the 5-port Power Delivery Charger from Anker. Connected to this charger, the Chromebook charged at a rate of 15V 2A (about 30 watts).\r\n\r\nOverall, this Dell Chromebook appears to be a strong performer with a strong exterior. It should definitely hold up as a daily driver while providing zippy performance.', ""I'm new to laptops and I know serious users laugh at Chromebooks. I absolutely love my Dell 2 in 1 Chromebook. I can't see ever using it as a tablet bc of the weight, but as a laptop it is more than enough for what I need. Plus I got it for $400 so I'm even more happy with it. I highly recommend the Dell 2 in 1 Chromebook to anyone in the market for a laptop, not so much a tablet."", 'My family is a fan of Chromebooks because they turn on fast and they rarely have glitches. This Premium 2-in-1 Dell Inspiron Chromebook has quickly become a favorite device as it is small enough to take on-the-go and it can be turned into a tablet. The gray metal design makes this laptop appear nice, sleek, and it feels solid. The active pen that comes with this Chromebook is simple to use, and it has its storage compartment under keyboard which makes it easy to keep the pen in one place. Furthermore, the battery life lasts a long time, which is what makes this device suitable for travel. The size of the keypad is big enough to allow movement of the pointer, and it is not bothersome as the texture is smooth. I like that the keys don’t feel cramped which makes typing comfortable. The best feature is the Full HD touchscreen; it is bright and with fantastic resolution. The speakers are along the bottom edges of the laptop, hidden, but it still does sound great. The sound is clear, efficient and quality are great. The thing that makes this 2-in-1 Chromebook the function is the ability to switch between a keyboard laptop into a tablet quickly. This laptop functions without a cooling fan thanks to its fast 8th generation Intel core processor. It does not overheat even after using it for a prolonged time. It weighs a bit more compared to the other Chromebooks, but it is still acceptable for mobility. This Dell 2-in-1 design sets it apart from other laptops. It is a premium Chromebook that I enjoy using.', '14 inch display is just the right size with the screen clarity and brightness levels just fantastic.\r\n\r\nLoad and startup speed is faster than it takes to open up the laptop. It takes longer to input your password than to load up. The apps are blazing fast. WiFi Download speeds are off the chart as is the connection throughout my multilevel house. \r\n\r\nThe storage available before you add apps is a little over 100GB. That may seem like very little but given the wide availability of cloud storage using various services (Google Drive, MICROSOFT One Drive and so on) I never found I was missing anything from my full sized laptop.\r\n\r\nHaving never used the Chrome OS, I had a learning curve which was a bit steep but then quickly flattened out. Now I just love the OS, the slick touchscreen responsiveness, the 2 in 1 ability and the overall quality build.\r\n\r\nThe power supply adapter connects to the laptop via a USB 3.1C port and quickly recharged the battery from 10% to 100% in under an hour. I also was able to get a bit over 6 hours doing light web browsing, photo editing, word processing and a few games played.\r\n\r\nA bio scanner would have completed the perfection of this Dell Chromebook. The price is a bit steep but the build quality is off the chart, the hinge is built for high daily usage, the back lit keyboard is a great feature, the tent mode is beautiful to have and use. \r\n\r\nLess I forget, you get a stylus that is built into its own slot on the front of the underside of the keyboard, easy to get to, easy to use and what a great inclusion.', 'I only use this Dell 2-1 14"" Chromebook for - All Things in the Google Universe (ecosystem), some other Play Store apps, social, internet, internet, internet and a writing app. I\'m not doing 3-D modeling or heavy photoshop. Do I wish I had more money and purchased a Pixel Slate with an i5 or 17 and more memory, yes. This is 4 pounds and the keyboard if stuck to it. I would prefer something 2 lbs or under with a detachable keyboard and a faster processor for when I use demanding apps. So far however I have not had any issue. The outdated i3 processor is doing everything fast I have asked of it. I keep multiple applications open and 25 tabs without a hint of delay. Next time step up and spend some more coin, plus I had 10 minutes to decide as Best Buy was closing, I was in a hurry...After spending thousands on a mac (they have less expensive ones) this is great, just without Garageband, etc. I use the heck out of this and it has worked very well except the wifi range isn\'t spectacular, however I have an old single band router and an only one slow internet with poor maintenance and at 12mbps - in the middle of the desert. The battery life is excellent. \r\n\r\nI am looking forward to a tablet in the future that does not have a fan, still stays cool and with a faster processor. I was told because this was solid state and did not have a fan, I must have misunderstood, it has a fan. Things with hinges will fail. \r\n\r\nFor the money it is so far so good. It was ""on sale"", isn\'t everything? I think some people who hate Windows like me, who like the Google cloud concept, and love the way this syncs to an android phone will like this set-up. It is like my mac before cat hair killed it and how it synced with my iphone, but less money. If I wasn\'t addicted to a stylus of the Note line of phones I might still have an iphone and I would have looked at ipads. This will help with my closeted wanna be writer ambition, research and most internet everything. It is fast for the things I do and boots up fast like a SSD should. Interactions are instant between Google apps.\r\n\r\nIf you are in this price range (on sale only; It was $150 less), aren\'t doing things that require a high end processor, don\'t mind the 4 lbs and think 14"" then maybe? If you have more coin and demand more from a device then step up I suppose. I\'ve had this less than a month so time might change my opinion. If I had more time to choose and think about it I would have spent more, gone lighter, leaner and more powerful$', ""This is my 3rd Chromebook in past year. Not because they are bad products, but because they tend get taken from me by my family members. I really love the Chrome OS based laptops. They aren't super powerful, but really productive.

And the keys feel great. the FHD display is gorgeous , for a Chromebook in this price range. It also has a stylus tucked away beneath it, to the right of the track pad . The back lit keys look and feel very premium. Speaking of premium, It 's got a fully aluminum body. DELL is known for making sturdy products anyway. I swear I could go on for hours and hours gushing about this Chromebook, but I'm just gonna drop a link to my online review, for a more in dept look at how I really feel. Now, the only problem I could possibly see in this unit is, the fact that it's so well built that it ends up weighing nearly 5 lbs. Good thing I workout often. As the name states, it's a convertible Chromebook. Meaning it can be used in laptop form, tent form and tablet form. That's where the issue lies. I don't see many people using this one in tablet form very much, considering the weight. But other than that, I totally recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade from their school Notebook.

6373038 ,"('This Dell 15"" convertible is a pretty good laptop. It\'s not perfect, as most aren\'t, but it has some really nice points. Here are my observations:\r\n\r\nBuild:\r\nBuild quality is pretty good. The aluminum body is attractive and feels solid and substantial. The weight is about what I expect for a 15-inch laptop. It has some heft although I wouldn\'t consider it overly heavy for regular laptop use. It\'s a convertible and the screen folds back to allow the laptop to be used in tablet mode. \r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\nPerformance is very good. The 10th generation i5 processor and 8GB of RAM provide quick, snappy performance. Windows open and close quickly, tasks execute quickly and reliably and multitasking is a breeze. Office 365 works like a charm on this system as well as more demanding apps like Photoshop. The 512GB SSD is spacious and quick. The system boots and shuts-down quickly as well. The out-of-the-box configuration has a feature where simply opening the lid powers on the laptop. It works similar to a Chromebook. Some may like or even love this feature but I\'m not among them. I was happy to discover it could quickly be disabled in the BIOS. I initially encountered an issue with Windows activation on first boot. I kept getting an error that there was no valid product key. A subsequent reboot and activation attempt didn\'t solve the issue. I finally solved it by running the Windows activation troubleshooter. In fairness to Dell, I recently encountered this exact same issue on another new laptop from a different manufacturer that was also running Windows 10 Home. I\'m fairly certain Microsoft is responsible for this glitch rather than Dell. The Thunderbird 3 port is awesome and true Thunderbolt 3 versus merely USB-C. It\'s fast and works with all my Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. \r\n\r\nDisplay:\r\nThe display panel quality is okay. I\' not a big fan of Dell’s mainstream display panels. I find them a little dim and warmer than I typically prefer. It\'s not just their consumer panels but professional machines as well. We have hundreds of Dell business laptops in use where I work. I manage them, so I have a very good point of reference. Dell has better panels available but they’ll cost you. I have a Latitude that I use for work with an upgraded panel. It\'s tack sharp, bright, vivid and has excellent color saturation. That laptop also cost quite a bit more than a nearly identical model lacking that particular screen and a few other minor extras. This is definitely more of a personal preference because my wife has a 14"" version of this laptop and she likes her screen. The touch panel responsiveness on this model seems pretty good. I\'ve never really warmed up to using a touchscreen on a laptop, so I honestly have no intention of using the touchscreen regularly, especially on a laptop this size. On the flip side, my wife uses the touchscreen all the time. So, again, my feelings are more a personal preference rather than a flaw.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nThe back-lit keyboard has a number pad and nice feedback. The keys don\'t feel mushy or stiff. The silver keyboard is color coordinated with the laptop chassis. It looks nice but the lack of contrast sometimes makes finding the keys a little more difficult. This is especially true when using the keyboard back-lighting in darker conditions. The silver keys, grey letters/numbers and white light all tend to blend into one another at times. It\'s much less contrasty compared to black keys. The back-lighting works well and is adjustable in three steps (off, low, high). The track-pad is average. There is nothing particularly great nor terrible about it. I\'m simply not fond of track-pads and have never found a one that I truly like on either Windows or Mac platforms. It\'s sufficient for use in a pinch but I purchased an external laptop mouse for regular use as I always do with a new laptop. The fingerprint sensor is integrated into the power button and works well the majority of the time. It occasionally requires me to re-swipe due to a failed read but no more than most of my other fingerprint enabled devices. Camera quality is average. It\'s a basic webcam with no notable bells or whistles. Sound is okay but the speakers crackle when playing sound. It happens with all sounds, regardless of source or format. I\'ve been trying to find a solution but thus far, new drivers and reinstalling the device haven\'t solved the issue. Bloatware is minimal. Other than Mcafee Security and Dropbox, the only other bloatware are Dell\'s OEM system management apps.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThis Dell 7000 2-in-1 has mostly good points but there are also a few not so good points as I\'ve noted above. Of the cons, only the sound issue is something I\'d consider major if I\'m unable to get it resolved. \r\nMy wife has an almost identical 14” Inspiron 5000 2-in-1. I believe the form factor of her machine is slightly more suitable for a convertible laptop. With that said, even her machine looks and feels a bit large, heavy and cumbersome in tablet mode although she doesn\'t seem to mind. This isn’t like a typical 10-inch or even 12.9-inch tablet that weighs under a pound and has a smooth flat back. It’s a five-pound laptop that is thick, heavy and forces you to rest your hand against the keyboard in handheld tablet mode. Once a machine hits or exceeds 15 inches, it makes for a clumsy convertible, especially when your hand has to rest against the keys. I don\'t see any practicality in convertible laptops larger than 11-13 inches. I also like the keyboard on her machine better. Although hers doesn\'t have the number pad, the black keys have better contrast. I included photos to show the difference in contrast. Lastly, hers is the i7 version although there is no noticeable difference in speed when using for regular desktop tasks and web browsing. They\'re both around the same price, so I\'d recommend this for someone looking for a larger convertible but if looking for the most practical option, I\'d recommend Dell\'s 14"" model.', 'I will start by saying this laptop is pretty, with a nice display, it is fast but with some trade off. This is a 2 in 1 which can be folded all the way and be used as a tablet. This specific model has an Intel i5 10th Gen, with 8GB of Ram, 512GB solid state hard drive and Intel UHD graphics card. The machine is pretty fast, setting it up took about a little bit over 10 minutes. The device is very well built with curved edges, and the silver color makes it looks flashy. The 15in touch screen display is bright with vivid colors, it gets a little brighter with the power plugged in. Despite the display is 1080P you can still watch 4k and 8k youtube videos and they look amazing. It has plenty of ports for its size, it has 2 USB3, one HDMI 2.0, SD card slot, Thunderbolt3 type C, and headphone jack. \r\n\r\nThe weight on this device I should say is fairly light when used as a laptop, but when in tablet mode it will feel kind of heavy and awkward to hold as you tend to press the keyboard keys. The size is perfect for travel as is not that heavy and will fit nicely in a small backpack. Battery life is pretty good too, after 100% charge, I watched Netflix and Youtube for about 3hrs and it still had over 70% battery life. After a day and a half of standby the battery still had 65%. On the bottom of the device it has stereo speakers, one on each side they are fairly loud but too much high pitch and no lows, there is something cool about them tho. Despite the fact that the speakers are on the bottom you can actually hear the sound coming from the center and all around which I found that pretty cool. If you play the sound too loud you can feel the vibration on the surface of the device when typing.\r\n\r\nThis device performs very well, programs runs pretty fast I did not notice any relative lag, and the screen is very responsive to the touch. The backlighted keyboard has a number pad which I definitely like and the power button acts as a fingerprint reader. On the display it has a front facing camera which based on the windows camera setting it is less than 1.MP. Another cool thing I liked was the MaxxAudio software when using the headsets via headphone jack. When the software is enabled it amplify the sound and when you allow the use of the front camera the sound will shift front left to right when you move your head, I found that pretty cool. I used beats over the head headphones to test this. \r\n\r\nMost of my experience was positive but I did find some negatives too. One thing that I was really annoyed by was the keyboard, the keys felt too bouncy and a little noisy, and I had to press hard on the space bar. I don’t know if it was faulty but it was very annoying. Another thing about the keyboard people with big or medium hand will end up having part of the left hand out in the air when typing, as the typing center is on the left side of the device leaving the left hand with relative no resting surface space. The mouse pad is very responsive but the actual surface feels kind of rough on your finger tips, it is not as smooth as other devices I have. \r\n\r\nThe graphics card is an Intel UHD, but the actual display is only 1080p at 60hz, so you will not be able to watch native 4K content. The front camera is less than 1MP, images did not look good at all and they were blurry, they could have put a better camera. Not labeled power button, I had to look around a little to find it, so I figure it should be the blank button on the upper right corner. \r\n\r\nOverall is a great device looks beautiful, performs well, and can be used in various form factors. In the box was the laptop, manual and charger.', 'Too many cool options to pick one as my favorite. \r\n\r\nLove the backlit keyboard, touch screen, snip and draw feature, tablet style, mini SD card slot, sleek design, blue tooth and overall functionality.\r\n\r\nI can now stay up in bed finishing up whatever I’m doing without disturbing my husband since the keyboard lights up. It does dim when not in use which is a great energy saver. The touchpad is ultra sensitive but can be easily adjusted...some features for certain programs may require sensitivity at the default level but it’s pretty much up to the end user. \r\n\r\nLove that I can blue tooth my headphones and leave my laptop’s side w/o missing a beat. I also tried a wired headset because why not. Sound quality great on both.\r\n\r\nThe tablet feature is amazing and flipping the laptop to sit like an easel is simple and the image rotated to face the right direction. With the touch of a keypad icon on the bottom of the screen you can type on the screen while having the laptop in this easel position. Drawing is amazing and using the snip and draw feature is so cool. I plan to buy a pen so I can really get great use out of using it as a drawing tablet since I’m currently into drawing and taking some online classes.\r\n\r\nI used the 2-1 while in the dark to ensure the keyboard would provide enough light for me to see and it did. I even used Inspiron to play online video games and it kept up nicely, even though it’s not a gaming laptop. \r\n\r\nThe sleek design makes for picking up the 2-1 and moving effortlessly around my home and integrating it into different activities. One minute I’m listening to music, the next I’m surfing the web, drawing, watching a video, all with ease since the touch screen is amazingly helpful when I don’t have both hands available to type. \r\n\r\nWhile I did set part of my new Dell up using voice prompts (accurate at listening to my voice) I didn’t continue to use the feature after the computer was all set up. \r\n\r\nIt comes with free McAfee antivirus but I chose to install a security software I have a brand preference for. \r\n\r\nThe snip and draw has an integrated ruler which is easy to manipulate and very accurately allows you to draw straight lines, even while in finger mode. \r\n\r\nThe picture quality and sound are fantastic and I enjoyed watching videos from various artists. \r\n\r\nThere are two super speed ports on one side of the laptop and the headphone jack. The other side contains an HDMI port, a thunderbolt port for plugging in iphones or other devices that need charging, all while the laptop is off but plugged in by its charger. \r\n\r\nThe mini SD slot is located same side as HDMI. When I first inserted the mini SD card, Inspiron didn’t recognize it, but a super fast driver update had me looking at the contents in no time. From what I’ve read, the mini SD card can be used for extended memory if you are short on memory or to have more Windows Apps installed. \r\n\r\nIt doesn’t come with a CD/DVD drive but most newer laptops have done away with this feature and most people tend to download or stream music and movies. I was a bit disappointed not having this feature BUT the many other cooler options make this small fry.\r\n\r\nThe laptop does not get hot and the battery life is just okay...I did “put it through the mill” to see if it can keep up with my multitasking but I had to keep plugging it back in to finish up. Since I’m not normally using a laptop for 6 hours straight...I will cut the 2-1 some slack. \r\n\r\nI recommend this 2-1 laptop to anyone looking to replace their regular laptop because the tablet/touch screen/drawing feature/backlit keyboard/weight is just so cool, you’ll regret repeating getting a regular laptop.', ""The Dell Inspiron 7000 is a very flexible machine with a great blend of the higher end features of top-tier laptops mixed with some mid-level finished that help keep the cost down to bring about an amazing value! This laptop is perfect for college students, writers, families looking to share a computer, and really anyone looking for a solidly versatile laptop that can excel at many different tasks with a fantastic keyboard and beautiful screen! I tested a few more demanding PC games to see how the 10th gen i5 would fair and was quite impressed! Don't expect to run newer games at ultra high settings but, at medium or low settings I was able to get around 30 FPS in GTA V, Fallout 4 (25 FPS), and CS:GO (75 FPS). I attempted Cities Skylines, a game that is not supposed to work with Intel integrated graphics but, it did work just at 8-12 FPS. The keyboard and typing experience gives a solid experience with great feedback and easy to find keys, one of the better keyboards I've ever typed on! The cinema screen is absolutely beautiful and begs you to continue watching your favorite shows and movies. There is an excellent selection of ports, including a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port that allows you to charge the laptop with a powerful enough USB-C charger, making charging on the go very easy! The only things I did not fully enjoy are the feet on the bottom are pretty slick (causing a fair amount of slide when opening the laptop) and the hinge balance when opening the screen lid. The balance thing is very minor and quick to get passed by using two hands and the sliding is only an issue before there is a little wear on the laptop's feet.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is an excellent laptop for most users and incredibly flexible! If you are looking for a versatile, do it all laptop that has a lot of higher end features, this is the laptop you're looking for!"", 'Open the box, plug it in, and it walks you through the rest of the set-up. Initially couldn\'t find the ""start"" button because the instruction drawing shows it to be on the left but it\'s actually on the right - not a big deal! Set up was smooth, display/picture is super clear quality, and sound is very good despite being a laptop. Connected to our wireless network without any issues. Processor seems fast, internet pages loaded quickly. Keyboard is smooth and easy to read. I plugged in a USB mouse and it recognized it immediately (I\'ll probably use it this way but it works equally well with the touch pad.) I anticipate replacing my desktop and using this on a regular basis. \r\nGreat product and we love it!', ""This is a very nifty 2-in1 computer. The biggest thing for me, was the display. I tend to buy laptops that get the job done, budget laptops with relatively large storage but aren't very powerful or have the best display. This Inspiron 7000 from Dell has the best HD display that I've ever seen on a laptop and with UHD integrated graphics and a HDR option, video will never look better on a HD display. I want to emphasize this particular model is not a 4K UHD display, just a regular HD display, but it's enhanced with the UHD and HDR features, which makes it much more affordable than the 4K option. Which, if you're coming to Inspiron for the best display and you can spare the extra money then go for it. But if you want a impressive machine that can fold into a tablet for video and with a very impressive HD display whose only rival is a 4K display, then this Inspiron is the one for you. It's also very efficient. I had some troubleshooting done just the other day and the rep that was helping me was very impressed with how fast things loaded and the response times overall. I too find it rather quick. It is the best laptop I've ever owned, miles ahead of the budget laptops I normally purchase. One downside on this particular device is the storage. I currently also own a 1TB laptop and can fill it rather quickly. However, this device is capable of handling additional storage options easily. It's also the smartest laptop I've owned. It's got a fingerprint sensor for security, a touch screen which I've never used before but find it a welcome addition and then it's Dell pen capable (does not include pen) for more tablet friendly productivity. Again, this is an impressive and powerful machine that will be great for those wanting to be productive and also enjoy high quality display formats."", 'Most of my computer equipment is based on the ""other"" operating system. This is one of the first Windows-based machines that I\'ve purchased in about 8 years and my first ""touchscreen"" 2-in-1 laptop. I needed to buy it for the business and I am quite pleased. I\'ve only been using it for about 2 weeks but the hardware itself feels like a really solid build and comes with Windows 10 pre-installed.\r\n\r\nIt is lightning fast and the touchscreen is very responsive. Converting it from a laptop to a tablet is quick and easy although with a near 15"" screen its not the most ergonomically ideal tablet because you have the weight of the keyboard included. Regardless it\'s responsive and convenient. With a 8GB of RAM and 512GB SSD I have plenty of memory to do author and present my work. I really like how you can flip back the keyboard and turn the unit into a ""tent"" for presentations. Setup was quick and easy and I loved the Cortana guided process. The fingerprint sensor for laptop access is pretty cool is well. \r\n\r\nPaired with my Microsoft Office 365 subscription, this makes for a solid machine for business.', '')"

Regardless of whether the plastic is gloss or matt, you will see every fingerprint. Styling grooves and a bit of plastic chrome attempt to give it a small amount of flair but the overall design is very muted. Around the edges you will find a myriad of ports from USB 3.0, USB-C, Thunderbolt, HDMI, mini Displayport, Ethernet, SD card slot, and a mini stereo jack. Connections that would require bulky cables are pushed to the back. Internally is a PCI-NVME SSD and a traditional hard driver for larger storage. It allows storage of much larger games without a prohibitively expensive SSD but comes with a tradeoff of some battery life.\r\n\r\nGeneral Usage\r\nThe chiclet keyboard feels responsive with decent travel but gives a solid thump at the bottom. It’s hard to judge responsiveness but compared to a dedicated gaming keyboard it feels nearly as fast. Unless you require extreme responsiveness or deep travel in your keys, this keyboard should do just fine. The trackpad is surprisingly good. Windows reports it as a precision touchpad. Palm rejection is very good, gestures work reliably, and overall the experience is very good. If there was any gripe, it would be that the surface is textured and provides a too much resistance. The screen seems to have been improved from previous models as it gets bright for the class. You aren’t going to be getting much done with it outdoors but in brightly lit room it is still very usable. Without a tester it is hard to judge the actual color accuracy but for normal daily use and gaming there aren’t any odd color issues that stand out. One thing to note is out of the box the fans were rather obnoxious ramping up to high speeds even while watching movie. You will notice them too because they have a bearing whine as they ramp up to speed. The good thing is after a slew of updates, including firmware, the system settled down to mainly turning on the fans during heavy usage. Even though the fan stabilized after the updates other random problems occurred where the keyboard and mouse stopped working for about a minute before recovering 4 times, plugging in a mouse once caused a bluescreen, and several times Windows complained that it wasn’t activated which suggest Dell has some minor tweaks that need to be done.\r\n\r\nDigging deeper into using it for watching movies, the speakers get crazy loud at times. On full volume it’s hard for anyone to have a conversation in the room. Sound quality is harder to explain. It’s not bad but lacks any sort of bass and midrange is slim. It’s a bit surprising for such a thick laptop to have no bass. That said, they have a type of surround sound that when you are the right distance away does a decent job of simulating some depth. It seems a bit gimmicky, but at the very least you can experience some surround sound.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nThe largest blemish is the 60Hz screen. For daily usage the 60Hz panel does just fine but putting a 60Hz panel in a gaming laptop in 2019 just defies logic. If you have ever gamed on a 144Hz panel or faster the ghosting will be almost impossible to miss on this screen. It’s a good thing Dell decided to have USB-C and Thunderbolt, so you have options to connect to better screens. The integrated keyboard works well for gaming and includes highlights for WASD and even has a nub on the S key to help you locate the center quickly. The medium travel keyboard means that you might find the thud at the bottom of travel a little off-putting, but if you can get used to it, it doesn’t affect responsiveness. Key spacing is good as to prevent accidental weapon changes from mashing two keys but if the keys were slightly dished this could be improved further. What does affect gameplay is the cramped direction keys. If you play driving games, like Asphalt, and use the directional keys instead of a gamepad you will run into issues. The keys are all half height making accurate key presses difficult. If Dell had maybe put a notch in the keyboard design to let the direction keys come down a little farther and allow full sized keys this would be perfect.\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\nThis is where things get interesting. The SSD Peaks at a decent 1241MB/s Read and 694MB/s write. Not the top of the pack but right in the middle, the same as the entire system. Windows runs quick as well as games once they are loaded off the traditional hard drive. Games still take their time to load but once a game loads the difference is noticeable. If you install steam on the SSD it only takes 3 seconds to launch. Assuming like most, you put your Steam library on your mechanical hard drive you can expect launch times, for example, just shy of 37 seconds for CSGO. Epic launched similarly launched in 3 seconds while Fortnite took a hefty 53 seconds to load. Having a Core i7 and 16GB of dual channel ram is nice but the real star is the GTX 1660Ti. Even coming from a GTX 1050 the performance boost is noticeable. Older titles, such as COD or Borderlands 2, can run smoothly with all settings maxed out at full HD. Fan noise is noticeable during gameplay but the speakers do a good job of drowning it out and they do provide special awareness of the direction of sounds helping you target better where sounds are coming from. That said, a good set of headphones will easily outperform and could provide some of that missing bass to improve the experience.\r\n\r\nAlienware Command Center is included to allow further tweaking of settings per game. Keep in mind, this is a paired down version of what is included on Alienware computers. It doesn’t include all features and you are reminded of this on launch with a warning that no supported hardware is found. Strangely it prompts to install an update which fails saying you need to uninstall the old version first instead of just removing or upgrading it for you. Once you get Alienware Command Center up to date you have the option to tweak certain system settings per game. Nvidia Control Panel allows you to change GPU settings per game like you are used to, but Command Center adds features that let you tweak hardware profiles for thermal performance, audio profile, CPU performance, and Audio Recon spatial audio. This can really come in handy if you have some more casual games for use on battery that you don’t want to use the GPU. You can set them to use the Intel graphics and silent profile meaning you can extend battery life and keep heat down so you can use it in your lap. Regarding heat, the base of the system can get uncomfortable warm during GPU heavy game play. Most of the time that isn’t much of an issue but if you decide you want to play something like Forza using WASD be prepared for some uncomfortable heat if you want to sit back with it in your lap and play.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show performance well above normal gaming laptops in 3D Mark with a score of 5787 versus an average of 3879 for gaming laptops. Overall, this puts it comfortably into the range of supporting Oculus and Vive and nearly to a 4K desktop gaming rig which is impressive. UserBenchmark testing pulls in an equally impressive score of 82% and rates it as an Aircraft Carrier. In real world examples, CSGO pulled in nearly 300fps with all settings maxed out! Frame rates would dip into the mid-100s off and on but never below 100fps with the overall average just below 200fps. With all settings maxed on Forza 4, framerates held just over 30fps with flickering. After a new update to the GeForce drivers was applied the framerate jumped up to 35-45fps with no flickering, but it couldn’t quite muster a stable 60fps.\r\n\r\nThe system does include a Killer Gigabit Ethernet adapter but with an internet connection of over 1Gbps and overall latency of less than 13ms it is impossible see any perceivable difference.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nCompetition the past few years for affordable gaming laptops is paying dividends for the customer. Overall the G5 is a solid gaming rig that can also do double duty as a work or school computer. Once all system updates and firmware updates are applied there is little to fault except the monitor, which can be avoided if you have the extra cash to purchase the G5 with the 144Hz monitor. You could maybe even configure it with the better screen and less storage since the hard drives and storage can be changed later. If you need to save the money or don’t care about higher refresh rates this could still do the job well. Overall the G5 lineup is very competitive for 2019.', 'Be advised that this is not a 2 in 1 so screen does not wrap around to create a “tablet”. Nor does it support touch screen or pen usage. So, if that’s what you are looking for this is not the unit for you. \r\n\r\nHard to believe that at this price this unit is considered an entry or maybe intermediate gaming rig.

Has hard wire ethernet connection too.\r\n\r\n60 Whr, 4 cell lithium-ion battery.\r\n\r\nPower and HDMI attachments are at the back which makes it nice/neat and sleek on the desk. \r\n\r\nExact dimensions are Height: 0.95"", Width: 14.3"" and Depth: 10.8"" and weight of my unit a little over 6 lbs.\r\n\r\n1-year warranty.\r\n\r\nThis is the link to Dells website for more info on this unit. https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-and-games/dell-g5-15-gaming-laptop/spd/g-series-15-5590-laptop/gnvca5cr1000s\r\n\r\n\r\nPositives;\r\n\r\nIt was fairly easy to setup. Plug it in, start it up and Cortana (NOT a fan) will walk you thru the setup process. I was up and running within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt is very nice looking with flat black case. With a sort of inverted steps (pyramid) for the base. Heavy duty hinges. \r\n\r\nHas Dell SupportAssist – given your view on such things may be a plus or a minus. I ran it initially to verify everything was up-to-date and no issues. It takes a while if you run all of the options and seems to sometimes “fight” with Intel or Windows updates.\r\n\r\nNo real “bloat” software to get rid of.\r\n\r\nBoots fast – thank you SSD - but I disable any software not really necessary during startup using Task Manager.\r\n\r\nIt is very fast processing pretty much anything. Apps open quickly and having multiple windows open is no problem for this laptop.\r\n\r\n1080P screen resolution/color is great for me with nice viewing angle.\r\n\r\nAs far as battery length I set it up to continuously run a 1080P movie (24fps) with screen at 75% and speakers at 25% and it ran for a little over 5 hours straight before hitting 10% battery. I did have wi-fi on as well but blue-tooth off. Didn’t have time to try gaming for 5 hours straight.\r\n\r\nYou can set the fan to quiet, normal or high performance (loud) – but settings can impact performance. I left mine on normal.\r\n\r\nThe USB ports are fast – especially if you have a USB-C device.\r\n\r\nPower cord is about 6 feet in length and is 2 pieces with no power block to deal with at plug in.\r\n\r\n\r\nNit-picky negatives;\r\n\r\nWindows 10 was not activated. I had to run troubleshoot option and it activated. Not sure why?\r\n\r\nWhen gaming fan goes to performance mode (which is good) but it is a tad loud (not so good).\r\n\r\nPower cord has large inline block.\r\n\r\nScreen is not edgeless.\r\n\r\nCase seems to smudge easily\r\n\r\nNo built-in high-performance power option that I could find\r\n\r\nSSD is only 256GB\r\nSATA drive is only 5400 rpm. With costs going down, down, down for SSD’s – why not put one in here? I guess Dell had a price point to hit and they had to “fudge” somewhere?\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall a nicely designed entry gaming unit that I hope will last years!', ""The Dell G5 laptop is esthetically nice and clean looking, very sleek and professional, . This 15.6 inch screen laptop is a little heavy, but very manageable.. \r\n\r\nLike others, I have and use both a tower, a laptop, and my smartphone for my computer use. I use a laptop for a lot of things: internet, email, office, school, photo editing, and gaming are all on that list. However, be aware that this is not like a 2 in 1 where it can either be a laptop or a tablet by flipping the screen in various positions. It also does not allow for finger screen writing. \r\n\r\nTo start with, the activation process and out of box set up was easy and uneventful. The SSD enables quick start up times both when initially starting up the computer, and then using Word and other Office software, Internet Explorer, and other applications, all at one time. The keyboard has a nice blue back light, clearly making it very easy to use in complete darkness with no ambient lighting necessary. This model's webcam is placed in an appropriate area, unlike those from the Dell XPS series. There was a little confusion on where the charging port was located, but I found the charging port on the back part of the laptop. \r\n\r\nNow, I found that while playing games on this laptop, the screen had nice clean colors on the screen, little lag time; overall, this laptop was great for the average to occasional gamer. The typing keys are reactive and rebound quite well with no sticking of the keys. As always with the new Dell laptops, tracking on the pad/mouse is accurately reactive to ones needs. I really like that Dell designed this laptop with a separate lite 10 key, very nice and very rare in the 15 inch models. Look at the close up picture that I have of the backlit keyboard, the A,S,D, and W keys are specifically rimmed all the way around the keys making it easy to move your characters in whatever gaming you are doing. \r\n\r\nJust a quick note, this unit has all of the extras such as 3 USB ports, an HDMI cable setup, an ethernet setup, and full size memory card slot. So, this machine comes with a 60 Whr, 4 cell battery that Dell says should let the laptop perform seamlessly on the move. Most gamers use a tower because it is plugged into an electric source and so power is never an issue while in the heat of the battle. That would be my only concern when gaming on a portable machine. \r\n\r\nOverall, this laptop is a great gaming computer for the average gamer. I tried it out on several different games with different skills and it performed just fine and well within my requirements. However, Dell states that this machine can easily be upgraded in areas such as memory card and RAM, but it certainly delivers a pleasurable experience as is."", ""Like a lot of people, I use my primary laptop for a lot of things: web, email, messaging, office, photo editing, 3D rendering and gaming are all at the top of that list. Dell must have been listening to me complain that I hadn't found a really solid laptop for a reasonable price that has a professional look and can still keep up with the games I enjoy playing. I don't feel comfortable bringing a glowing rainbow-colored child's toy into a conference room but I still want to be able to play a frustration-free game from this decade at home in the evening. The Dell G5 5590 is understated, powerful and yet offers few compromises - which is fairly impressive at this price.\r\n\r\nGaming:\r\nFirst and foremost, this is a laptop designed for gaming, even with its professional looks. With an Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 9th-Gen Intel i7-9750H, this laptop has desktop-class specs on paper. To test how it really keeps up, I started with a suite of common benchmark tests and compared the G5's scores with the average for those components. Laptop designs can make compromises on clock speeds, power and cooling to fit higher-end chips in little boxes. Impressively, my G5's scores were above average against other machines (including desktops) sporting the same chips. Overall, this laptop out-performed 97% of other tested systems with ANY specs across CPU, 2D/3D, memory and disk benchmarks if that gives you any idea what kind of power the G5 is packing. In real-world tests, my G5 was able to reliably keep every game I play at ~60 FPS (ARK: Survival Evolved is a demanding game, for example, but played smoothly). Some less-demanding games with V-Sync off easily hit 300+ FPS. It should be noted that this model G5's display is limited to 60Hz, so anything above 60 FPS is generally academic unless you're plugging into a gaming monitor or you just get a warm fuzzy turning off V-Sync and seeing high numbers in the corner of your screen. There are other models of the G5 that pack faster display refresh rates and an RTX 2060 under the hood which is nice, but you're also going to pay for the privilege. This model also sports a Mini DisplayPort and a USB-C port if VR gaming is your thing.\r\n\r\nInput devices:\r\nThe chicklet keyboard on the G5 has a very nice feel and I like the understated blue glow coming from the backlight. It's both helpful for late night use and pleasant on the eyes. The trackpad is very responsive. The only issue that I have is that the texture of the trackpad is just a bit too coarse and therefore has just a bit too much drag. Time will tell if this becomes less of an issue as things break in, but I'm using a mouse 99% of the time anyway, so it's not a deal-breaker for me.\r\n\r\nDisplay:\r\nThe 1920x1080 60Hz display is pleasant to look at and the bezels are thin but present. I find the built-in display vibrant if not fussily color-accurate but I don't have any tools to measure color accuracy right now other than an external monitor that I have been able to calibrate on another system in the past. My G5's display is a little over-saturated in comparison but certainly accurate enough for everything that doesn't require professional-level color work.\r\n\r\nHeat:\r\nSo, under stress this laptop gets really warm. I expected this, and I use a lap desk with cooling fans built in. I found after a nice long gaming session pushing the G5 to the limit, my G5 was toasty but at least not finger-roasting hot. The little blue cooling bars you can see through the bottom grates can only do so much with the power needs of the components here. Under normal loads (web surfing, office, etc.) it's a perfectly well-behaved laptop. Also note that, when the fans kick in under heavy load, you'll definitely hear them but I did not find the fan noise excessive. \r\n\r\nI really like my Dell G5 and it is going to be my daily driver for quite some time. The dual 256GB SSD and 1TB HDD are speedy and spacious respectively. I finally found a do-it all gaming laptop I could afford and I can carry into a meeting without embarrassment."", 'The performance of this laptop is impressive and a great value at this price point. With the SSD, startup is like turning on your TV and with the 1TB Hard Drive you ample storage. Its very stylish in black with the bright blue backlit keyboard (picture of keyboard included). It is a bit heavy, but lets face it, you aren\'t buying this laptop to carry it around like a notebook, you want it to get your work done and play advanced games.\r\n\r\nI have been playing Battlefield V on it the last few days and its flawless. The graphics on the full 1920 x 1080 60hz setting in the game are awesome and very smooth with the hardware of this laptop. (Note I tested unplugging the power cord while playing and as expected it could not handle these settings on battery) I have also used the HDMI port to connect to my 27"" 4K monitor and utilized one of the several USB ports to connect my Xbox controller for game play. The dual fan system does run constant while gaming, throwing out a lot of air and can be noisy, but understandable with the high end performance. Once you go back to using just windows things are very quiet and the fan is either off or running very low. \r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell, this is a very powerful laptop that can serve your free time with current PC games, while plugged into the wall, but it can unplug to be mobile and do work wherever you need to go giving you 5 hours of productivity on a charge.\r\n\r\nI\'m very happy with this laptop and would recommend to anyone looking for a dual purpose laptop.', ""I love this laptop, looks very sleek and professional. \r\nPulls off double duty (work/play) very easily. This is a gaming laptop and dose gaming very well. And it is also more than you need for things like e-mails, surfing the web, YouTube, Netflix, Office 360 and so much more.\r\nUnboxing you will find just the laptop, power cord and user manual.\r\nPowering up windows will walk you through the initial set up, It's fast and easy.\r\nThe keyboard is back lite with a blue light. And has three setting low/high/off. The keyboard it self is very sturdy with almost no flex when pushing down hard in the middle of it. It just feels good when using it. I do wish the arrow keys were a little bigger. The touch-pad was very responsive and worked great.\r\nThis laptop performed with well on the 3DMark benchmark test.\r\nThanks to the GeFore GTX 1660 TI,16GM of ram and the 9th gen core i7-9750H CPU @ 2.6GHz.\r\nFor the most part the fans only kicked on in high with intense gaming and running the benchmark test. You can definitely hear them but not so loud as to distract you. And the fans pull air from the bottom and two sides pushing hot air out the back away from you. \r\nHas plenty of ports to met your needs. If your like me and like to use multiple monitors there is an HDMI out just for this. You will also find 3 USB A,1 Type C and a 3.5mm headphone jack. \r\nHas lots of room for all your games with a 1TB hard drive and a 256GB solid state drive for fast start up times.\r\nAnd comes with all of the other stuff most laptops have like wireless networking AC,ethernet card 10/100/100,Bluetooth, Webcam & speakers.\r\n\r\nAll in all if your looking for a powerful gaming laptop you have found one here! Just grab your favorite head set and gaming mouse and you're all set."", 'This is a highly capable gaming laptop. It can handle just about anything you can throw at it. Every game I\'ve tried on it has been auto set to high, high/ultra, with the exception of Black Ops 4, which wouldn\'t auto detect/set the settings. I set it to ""High"", and it played the game smoothly. It plays Monster Hunter World at high settings, FPS MAX set to 60, and V-Sync on, at an almost constant 60 FPS. Monster Hunter is a very demanding game, and this laptop handles it with ease for the most part.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things I take issue with in this laptop. The most obvious is the screen. Dell put all this wonderful, highly capable hardware into this machine, and then put the worst screen I\'ve ever seen/used on a laptop. It\'s very dark, and the colors are dull, and only 60Hz. I did the best I could to correct/calibrate the screen issues, but you are extremely limited to the software. Look at the attached picture to see what I\'m talking about. To do most of my testing, I ran an HDMI to an external monitor because it was so bad. Another issue is the CPU. The i7 9750H is a beast, but it runs hot, really hot. This laptop idles at 55-60C. I was having issues in some games, which was caused by thermal throttling. I was able to alleviate most of this by using a program called ThrottleStop. That was a game changer. I highly recommend you use it on this machine. Another issue is how loud the fan gets while gaming. It wasn\'t a big deal for me, because I had headphones on and couldn\'t hear it, but my wife could, and had to crank the TV volume up to hear her show.\r\n\r\nOverall, I really like this laptop. It can do it all with a few tweaks. You could use this as your main PC and gaming rig. It\'s lightweight, and thin. \r\n\r\nHere is a link to a UserBenchmark I did so you can see how it compares in real life: https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/18339723.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to actual gameplay footage on the G5 5590: https://youtu.be/saEYk8qrW-I', '')"
6339275 ,"('I am very impressed with this Dell Inspiron and pleasantly surprised by how many features have been included.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the Core i7 processor speeds up many tasks and the 16GB RAM is necessary to run Windows 10 comfortably. Some machines skimp with lesser processors or settle for 8GB RAM but not this one. I find it quite snappy to open apps and generally do any of my usual tasks although newer games still take a while to load up – which is to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe 512GB SSD is fast but may run out of space quickly if you put a few modern games on it. I added a couple I owned on a different platform but they started to fill the drive up. You could always use an external drive for games, which over the included USB 3.0 connections should work well. If you just stick to cloud storage and personal documents, the 512B SSD is quite roomy for both the Windows operating system and personal documents.\r\n\r\nThe 15.6” screen is gorgeous – I was blown away by the way it renders some images. With 4K display and the ability to show colors in high dynamic range, it will impress you. I noticed that the pre-loaded Dell software had a program for Dolby Vision installed and as I have Dolby Vision on a couple of my TVs, I was interested to compare it to the laptop screen. I fired up Netflix and streamed “Drive to Survive” which was filmed in both 4K and Dolby Vision and the picture was stunning for a computer screen.\r\n\r\nI tried a couple of games on the laptop as well. They looked excellent and made use of the HDR capabilities of the laptop. The games compared well to how they run on my console and I was impressed that a laptop video card was running so smoothly.\r\n\r\nThe NVIDIA GeForce MX250 graphics card seems robust and the onboard 2GB GDDR5 memory seemed to do well when I ran benchmark software against it.\r\n\r\nThe screen is touch screen as well as able to support the included stylus. I have not tested the stylus/pen very much but my quick plays in Word showed it to be fairly responsive and accurately recording my sketches and handwriting. The stylus stores neatly in a magnetized slot in the display hinge. The buttons on the stylus worked well and allowed me to erase and perform other functions built into the Office suite. I’m not a student but if I was, this functionality would be incredible.\r\n\r\nThe screen and keyboard can be manipulated so that the laptop turns into something resembling a tablet. It’s a heavy tablet (the keyboard can’t be removed) but useful for extended note taking with the stylus or reading via an app. You can also arrange the screen like a tent, which could be useful if following a video tutorial in the kitchen for example, saving the keyboard from getting any ingredients on it!\r\n\r\nThe combination ‘On button” and fingerprint reader seems to work well although it sits anonymously at the top right of the keyboard and does not light up like the other keys do when backlit. I set up finger print logon for myself and my wife and it has been rock solid when switching between user profiles.\r\n\r\nThe sound was mostly good although the lack of any bass or low frequency was very noticeable. There are probably not many options to improve this but I liked the mid range and thought that vocals were very clear. Sound in games was good although I would probably just plug gaming headphones in to play longer term. The SoundMaxx app appeared to have settings to add surround sound for headphones so that was covered. TV shows were very clear when I streamed them and I would have no complaints taking the laptop on trips and relying on the built-in speakers.\r\n\r\nThe CinemaStream feature, which tames your wireless channels so they will stream videos or music without buffering, seems to work well. I ran Netflix for a while to try to get it to stutter but it ramped up the 4K stream very quickly and never dropped it or buffered the whole time I watched.\r\n\r\nThe battery seems to last well so far. I haven’t yet used it enough to say how good it is and obviously battery usage changes depending on how much load the system is under – games and heavy wireless Internet usage will push it very hard. Charging is very fast though – even when run down, I noticed that the ExpressCharge feature was charging it back up rapidly and I could use it again much quicker than I am used to with other laptops and batteries.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a fantastic laptop and so far, the best I have owned or used. It is a little heavy but in the acceptable range and worth the extra weight for the features that are packed in. As a casual, home use laptop, it won’t be pushed anywhere near its limits but I could see this being an exceptional laptop for a student, with the speed, storage and note taking capabilities they require, as well as some fun features for recreation time.', 'This Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 laptop is a great choice for those who are looking for a faster and smoother experience. Dell is a trusted American computer brand with great customer service. This laptop has specifications that can be seen on laptops with much higher price tags, including 16GBs of memory and a 512GB SSD. If you’re buying a new laptop in 2019, get one with a solid state drive like this one. It’s much faster, meaning a better experience. It’s ready to go in less than 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nVisually speaking, this laptop looks great in black. It’s sleek, modern and streamlined, and it has a nice high quality feel to it.\r\n\r\nIs this a gaming laptop? Yes and no. It comes installed with a 2GB GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce MX250 graphics card and a quad-core 8th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, which does make it possible to play video games, but don’t expect to be able to play the newest games with max settings.\r\n\r\nI play video games mostly on my Xbox One X, so I was able to connect my Xbox One controller to the laptop through Bluetooth. I installed Forza Motorsport 7 which is a 100GB download through the Windows Store. The store throttled my download speed down to 20 Mbps, so it took about 9 - 10 hours for the download to finish. The game works fine on the laptop, and the Xbox One controller responds as expected. The game ran on Dynamic Low in 720p, which is obviously not as crisp as its Xbox One X counterpart, but quite nice for a more portable setup. I suggest sticking to games that are less demanding.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do with this laptop, you will be amazed by the gorgeous 4K display. It looks wonderful with a sharp, bright and detailed image. I truly enjoy looking at it, and haven’t been this impressed with a laptop screen since I got my retina MacBook Pro back in 2012. The screen also has the benefit of being touchscreen so you can use it as a big tablet if you want.\r\n\r\nA pleasant surprise for me personally was when I discovered that this laptop comes with a stylus, the Dell Active Pen. It makes drawing/painting so much fun, and I can’t recommend it enough for any creative person out there. I’m no artist, but I’m having so much fun with it anyway.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is very comfortable. It’s backlit in case you do a lot of late night typing on airplanes or in dark spaces, and it has a pleasant feel and sound. The power button is also a fingerprint scanner, so that you can unlock it with your fingerprint. It works very fast, but I’m still deciding whether it’s in the right spot or not. If you have something right next to the laptop on the right side, it feels a little awkward to put your finger down on the scanner. Other than that, it works very quickly and recognizes my fingerprint, most of the time. I do recommend against using your thumb, as it encourages an awkward pose while unlocking your computer.\r\n\r\nI’m never a huge fan of laptop touchpads, and if I had to point out one weakness, it’s the touchpad. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not bad, but I will point out a few weaknesses. It doesn’t respond well to holding, for example moving an icon. I might have to repeat the action a few times. As a right-handed person, I’m not a big fan of it being on the left side. Maybe the benefit is that you can rest your arm on your stomach depending on your position, but I still would prefer it in the center.\r\n\r\nThe built-in stereo speakers are just okay. The sound is kind of tinny, so don’t expect a lot of low end. I never expect much from laptop speakers so I always use headphones or speakers. I tried connecting this to a bluetooth speaker and syncing was easy. It improved the sound tremendously. You can also improve the sound through the included software.\r\n\r\nBattery life felt normal for a laptop, I would say an average of 4 - 5 hours of actual usage, but it depends heavily on how you use it. It might last about 2 hours of gaming. It does allow fast charging so that you can charge it up again pretty fast. An hour charge can get you back up to about 80 - 90 %.\r\n\r\nBefore I wrap this up, just a heads up, this laptop does not include a built-in DVD/CD drive. I also want to make a correction. The Best Buy specifications say no webcam, but it does have a webcam. For photos it’s 0.9 Megapixels and for videos it’s 720p. That might sound a little low, but the image quality is actually very nice with a good white balance. There is an SD card reader but only microSD.\r\n\r\nOverall, I really like this laptop and I’ll be using it for years forward. I am upgrading from a 2017 HP laptop, and even though they share some of the same specs, this one is the true winner. I’m very satisfied.', 'I have used this DELL 4k laptop for about a week and it has been fantastic for productivity and gaming! The Solid state drive and the bigger ram makes this lightning fast in everything you do, from starting up the computer, loading programs, multiitasking and everything you do on the laptop. The pen is a nice bonus and is really nice for artists to draw, there is even a slot for the pen to rest below the screen that fits in perfect. The screen is nice, clear, sharp and some of the best resolution out there. The speakers are booming at times and can be a little loud. I ran some Gears of War 4 on this PC and it runs smooth as a charm, no lag and looked great on the 4k screen, gaming was fun and convienient, i was able to stream my xbox and lay back in bed to play with an xbox one controller, love how the way this worked. Only thing i didnt care for was how huge and awkward the tablet mode is, the thing weighs like 8 lbs so using it as a tablet is not really light and portable as most devices. The mobile connect option is really cool as you can take your calls and texts through the PC similar to the way mac and iphone works. This computer is also very slim for all the high end parts they have packed into this computer.

Apparently, it just gave up this past Sunday and flat-lined by refusing to even get to the log-in screen. They had me factory reset it and I lost all of the homework I\'d done thus far for a class because it was on an installed application. No problem, this wouldn\'t happen again, right so I\'ll try to re-do what I remember? Wrong. At least when it blue-screened, I could start where I left off once I booted it up again. After the reset, it constantly tried to ""Automatic Repair"" itself and suggested restarting the device. Then it got stuck in a loop of rebooting and prompting the same thing. On top of that, when I called Dell, they insisted the hard drives underwent amazing quality control and as a result that the next time I\'d call, I\'d be referred to the software time and subsequently charged as my warranty only covers hardware issues. I had them remotely access my laptop to triple-check that it was fine and it\'s still doing this. I\'m returning this.

But with some research and time, you can easily do the upgrade to 144hz for around $100.\n\nNow this is a great laptop for the price that your paying.  You can go with bigger name brands and pay a premium sticker price and wont get the RTX2060, the storage space, and full size keyboard with 10 key on the side.  The only thing missing is a faster panel (as mentioned).  \n\nThe setup can be a bit of a pain to get the RGB keyboard working being that updates need to be installed from the Microsoft Store and Dell\'s website.  Once everything is right, you won\'t be let down at all.  This is Mid to upper reaching, solid laptop that is able to handle all that you throw at it.\n\nMy favorite thing is its only weakness.  I wanted a laptop that could game that didn\'t look like a gaming laptop.  There are better ""slim"" gaming laptops out there but their prices are much higher and they lack some features that you have here.  The downside here is heat.  This thing never gets hot to the touch but when your gaming or just running in performance mode you will be hearing the fans ramping up all the time and core temps can easily get higher than you really want.  Space under this thing is your friend.  That being said if you keep it out of performance mode it will stay cool and not be to loud.  \n\nAll in all I love this laptop and am happy I didn\'t take it back just because of the screen\'s fresh rate.  After a month with this thing I am very pleased.  The addition of a laptop cooler has helped turn this thing into a much quieter and cooler machine.', 'I really took my time and researched prebuilt gaming towers and gaming laptops configurarions vs initial price.  This laptop hovering just about $1000 (Black Friday) is worth every dollar.  I admit that I increased the memory to 32 GB (as I develop), but I did leave the 256 GB SSD/ 1 TB HDD config. As I bought the 5TB WD 3.0 USB external (also Black Friday) for $89-  no need to switch UNLESS you get a great deal for a 1TB (minimum) internal SSD.  Initial startup is still lightning fast and if you install games from Steam or even Gamepass (make sure your OS  is upgraded or the BETA app will freeze your system during install) make sure the files are saved on the external- you will be set!  I have run Modern Warfare and Gears 5 on it... #nice.  If I had one ""negative"" about this laptop is that it can get loud when running a graphics heavy game.  As I wear my headset while gaming- not an issue.    Oh... if you are debating the Best Buy Replacement Plan... DON\'T.  It is worth the piece of mind especially if you plan on taking this everywhere and allowing others to use it.  Can\'t tell you how many times someone (not naming names or ages...lol) accidently spilt soda on my machine or dropped it from a counter.

6299543 ,"('There is a lot to dive into in my days of testing this ultrabook. This is perhaps Dell\'s best attempt to bring back life into the Inspiron\'s life. Have they succeeded in doing that to me? Yes. I really do applaud Dell for actually excelling in design and performance in such a small and thin 15-inch package. I was previously using a Dell XPS 2-in-1 13"" laptop, This Inspiron 7000 series is miles better than the XPS in so many ways from I/O ports to the design. In fact, let\'s talk about that for a second. \r\n\r\nDesign: First off the design is just downright gorgeous. No, seriously I am attracted to the design of the ultrabook and Dell stepping up their game to make something much better. it\'s like having a windows version of a MacBook in a way, closer in design with a MacBook than an XPS but it works. Dell has crushed it again, I love how it feels thin and the premium it is while keeping all the important I/O ports as is. on the left side is an HDMI, USB-C (for power and video out), headphone port while on the right is two full-sized USB 3.0 ports and a (full-sized) SD card slot. There is a fingerprint reader for the power button and I\'ll get more into that later. The trackpad feels perfect to the touch when using windows. The keyboard has decent travel and it feels good to type on. Great distance is fine with me and I\'m writing this review on the ultrabook. The keyboard is also backlit with 3 levels (off, low, and high) when powered on. There are silver accents around the trackpad and fingerprint reader that adds that elegant design element. \r\n\r\nThis Inspiron has strong hinges for the laptop screen and feels like they are well constructed to last. The vents are at the bottom but there are vents near the screen\'s hinges. Airflow is fine. Dell didn\'t play around with the build quality and I\'m shocked. \r\n\r\nDisplay: The display is beautiful at 1080p but the borders around it are three-sided that almost give it that edge to edge feel. It\'s not infinity edge display dell has but its good. Plus the controversy placement on the XPS camera put some people off but here on the Inspiron the camera is at the top just smaller. I have to say the screen doesn\'t get that bright even at the highest levels. I have seen somewhere that it was 200 nits but that seems to be true and the glossiness of the screen reflects light. Keep that in mind when buying this. I will say that the screen is vibrant and colorful, I guess one of the big things here is Dell\'s new ""CinemaScreen"" which changes the profiles of colors on the screen. \r\n\r\nThere are 4 modes of position you can place the laptop into since this is a 2-in-1. Laptop mode, Tablet mode, Tent mode, and Presentation mode.\r\n\r\nLaptop Mode: Standard mode you and most likely other people will use. Nothing special here, This mode makes it look like a basic laptop and the mode Dell clearly designed this machine to be. Its lightweight enough. \r\n\r\nTablet Mode: Turns the laptop into a full windows tablet. The basic task is great for the tablet mode and The keys on the keyboard deactivate in this mode. Here though if you manually want to put the tablet in sleep you have to press the power button/fingerprint. It\'s placed on the right side near the keyboard so you can easily lock/unlock the device.\r\n\r\nTent Mode: This makes the laptop pop up into tent mode so you can watch or play your Media, Music, or even play some old school games in a ""Nintendo Switch"" fashion. it\'s nice to just pop it up and watch Hulu like an HDTV. I use PS4 remote play/Xbox Streaming to this PC in this mode. \r\n\r\nPresentation Mode: Same like tent mode this pretty much make your screen more accessible. Allows easy touch for the screen and showcasing what you have on screen to friends/family/Co-workers. Also might be the mode you would use to draw on screen if you have the optional Dell stylus (which I don\'t have.) The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop...\r\n\r\nSound:...And it couldn\'t be a better place for what this laptop can do. since in presentation mode it would be covering up sound it was a smart move by Dell to do. also in laptop mode, they don\'t get covered up, combine the ""MaxxAudioPro"" in the laptop software and you would have a full ranging sound that you can hear across the room in the house.\r\n\r\nBattery life: Dell 2-in-1 Ultrabook last with my task about 8-10 hours doing just day to day tasks such as checking Emails, News, Youtube, Netflix, Apple Music, Hulu, and Pandora. I love the battery life especially if you turn down the brightness a little you can made it a whole day but your task my very. Dell\'s power management software gives you a range of options to optimize battery life and see some stats about the health of the battery. Dell even added a quick charge option for people who need to charge up their laptop fast.\r\n\r\nPerformance: Is there such a thing as too fast? because the speed of this ultrabook is super insane. The Intel Core i7-8565U Whisky lake, 8GB (upgradeable!) and 512 SSD combined.... let\'s just say you don\'t have to worry about this thing slowing down at all. The ultrabook is fast and speedy. its rapid boot times are insane. Day to day tasks just open up with ease and it\'s not a headache to wait for things. Chrome opens up within a blink of an eye as soon as you turn on the PC. The fingerprint scanner is blazing fast. Long gone are the days waiting for the PC to boot-up killing your battery. I love it, I have never experienced anything is fast. I have no complaints about performance at all and certainly going to move away from a Chromebook.\r\n\r\nWindows 10 / Windows Hello / Voice Assistance: Windows 10 Home helps this laptop to feel even more premium. One of the most productive and versatile electronics I\'ve used in my lifetime. As for Windows hello the IR camera update is inbound for the summer but the fingerprint scanner is flawless and works as good as any modern fingerprint unlocker on cell phones. No Issues when signing in. Cortana comes standard on the laptop but NOW you can download Amazon Alexa from the Windows store and use it. It works as expected you on a Windows PC. More improvements will come over time. \r\n\r\nDell Pen / Windows Ink Workspace: This also works with Dell\'s very on stylus/pen but have yet to try it. I also heard that the Windows Surface pen works on these displays but again I don\'t have the tools to test these things. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nNo Nvidia/AMD GPU: Good ol\' Intel UHD Graphics are here. I am aware you can get a model with a GPU but that\'s all that is missing even for just some light gaming. It would have nice to throw into this model but I know this is a Best Buy issue, not a Dell one. Plus I\'m sure its also to save battery. \r\n\r\nNo Intel Optane Memory: Its configured for it but it\'s not in this laptop. \r\n\r\nBSOD: As awesome as this laptop is and its blazing fast, but you not everything is perfect. I have already had one blue screen of death. I have to call this out as it is an expensive laptop and it only happens once. (in pictures) but I have to inform you guys that it has happened. Maybe because I was updating everything and restarting. (which I recommend you doing as soon as you get the ultrabook is updated it completely.) \r\n\r\nArrow keys need space from PgUP / PgDn: They are way too close to the arrow keys to the PgUP/PgDn. You may end up hitting these way more then expected. \r\n\r\nFun mentions: I love using the Dell Software ""Mobile Connect"" I can have my iPhone or Android connected to the PC to make calls. While this isn\'t a big Dell to Android users, You can send messages and make calls with an iOS device. Finally, a way for iOS users to have an easy way to do this with PC. While you can\'t mirror your phone full display like on Android. You can do the basic normal task you don\'t have to pick up your phone for. You have to download the app from Apple\'s App store and it works just fine. make sure you update as well. THANK YOU DELL. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I still love this product. I love it much more than I do the XPS 13 which had a ton of design problems for me. The Inspiron 7000 15"" 2-in-1 has all the I/O ports you would want in a modern laptop. The display is wonderful, the sound is loud, The performance is BLAZING. Its extremely versatile and a phenomenal productivity tool Dell has produced. I wish there was a better-dedicated GPU but it\'s still fast on its own. I would certainly recommend this to Students/Co-Workers and family/friends. Dell is bringing in a new era for themselves and pushing their limits of design each year. It clearly shows here they care to listen to their customers.', 'BUILD QUALITY (3/5):\r\n\r\nAmong other 2-in-1’s that I’ve tried, this one is not marketed as a ‘premium’ 2-in-1. The lid and hinges are metal, but the rest of the machine is basically plastic. That being said, the plastic material feels good and doesn’t attract fingerprints like other glossy plastics.\r\n\r\nWhen closed shut, the display is not flush to the surface where the keyboard is. Whether you look from the left side, right side, front or back, the display looks slightly concave down—leaving gaps open for dust, debris and liquids to climb in. To be completely fair, plenty of other laptops have visible gaps between their displays and the keyboard surface, but most of the laptops I’ve reviewed (even from Dell) had displays that were parallel to the keyboard surface. To me, this seems like a Quality Assurance issue, which is a shame.\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, the keyboard is also not level. Many keyboards on devices at this price (or even cheaper) have straight keyboards, but this one skews from the ‘D’ key all the way to the right side of the keyboard. I don’t want to exaggerate and say that it’s a dramatic decline, but the right side of the keyboard is slightly lower than the left side of the keyboard, and that’s annoying and leads to a less consistent feel and typing experience.\r\n\r\nLastly, the hinges where the display rotates are not perfectly aligned (see pictures). This is another quality control issue that I don’t think should be overlooked at this price point.\r\n\r\nDISPLAY QUALITY (4/5):\r\n\r\nThis Inspiron 2-in-1 uses a 1080p IPS display from LG—specifically, the LG D05C4. Unfortunately, there aren’t listed specs out there, but Dell calls it their “Truelife Touch Narrow Border IPS Display with Active Pen support”. From my experience, it gets very bright with vibrant colors, but in the dark with a completely black image, it’s obvious that the display suffers from uneven backlighting along the edges. That being said, unless you’re viewing content with black boxes (such as 18:9 or 21:9 aspect ratio movies), you probably won’t really notice this very often. And although this is an IPS panel, I did notice that viewing angles are not as great as other IPS displays. There is a slight decrease in perceived brightness when viewing from a 45 degree angle. Aside from that, the display quality is otherwise decent and lent to an enjoyable experience with full-screen content.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the thin bezels around the display lend to a more immersive experience for content-viewing. It’s surprising that there are still laptops more expensive than this that have bigger bezels. Good choice, Dell.\r\n\r\nTOUCH SCREEN INPUT (5/5):\r\n\r\nTouch Screen input has been very reliable, in my experience—exceeding the reliability of some premium 2-in-1 devices, which is impressive. I have not had issues with accidental touches or anything of that sort. If you plan to use the touch screen functionality with this Inspiron 2-in-1, I think you’ll be happy with the experience.\r\n\r\nPEN SUPPORT (5/5):\r\n\r\nRegarding Active Pen support, take this with a grain of salt. Unfortunately, I did not have access to one of Dell’s own Pens, but I did have access to the HP Pen. My HP Pen worked with this Dell, out of box without any configuration. And even more so, it worked on the Dell way more reliably than the premium 2-in-1 the HP Pen was made for. Seldom did I encounter missed strokes. This probably means that Dell is using better touch screen firmware. I can’t attest to Dell’s own Pens, but this has been one of my most reliable pen experiences on a 2-in-1.\r\n\r\nKEYBOARD (3.5/5):\r\n\r\nThe keyboard on this Dell lacks tactility and feels slightly mushy for my personal tastes. Given the price that you’re paying, I think Dell could have done better. Not to mention the declination from the ‘D’ key all the way to the right side of the keyboard. It’s not a bad keyboard, as I’ve tried much worse, but I can’t help but feel a bit cheated, considering the price. This isn’t touted as a premium 2-in-1, but I’d expect a bit more quality control than this. I don’t think there are excusable reasons for this keyboard lacking the quality control at this price.\r\n\r\nTOUCHPAD (5/5):\r\n\r\nDell is using the Precision touchpad drivers from Microsoft, and thank goodness they are. The experience is snappy, gestures are responsive and reliable. The touchpad has a slight grain texture to it that is unobtrusive. Some might prefer a smoother surface, but I don’t mind this implementation. You can’t left and right click simultaneously on these touchpads, but that’s usually not a problem for me. Regardless, the surface is large and makes it easy to navigate your cursor across the whole display without issue.\r\n\r\nSOUND (3/5):\r\n\r\nThe sound of these speakers is unfortunately average/cheap. They’re only bottom-firing, and the sound is rather tinny and lacks bass, but is otherwise loud. No real tangible improvements in tent mode. While there is Waves MaxxAudio Software for you to tweak the EQ and such, I found that doing so didn’t really improve the experience. Would definitely love to see more care put into the speakers on a computer of this price point. \r\n\r\nI/O (4/5):\r\n\r\nThe Inspiron 2-in-1 has a decent selection of ports for your convenience. Firstly, has a DC powecalcr jack for charging, but also has a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type C port with Power Delivery & DisplayPort. Additionaly, there are 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, an HDMI 2.0 port, headphone/microphone combo jack, and a full-size SD Card reader. Unfortunately, there is no Thunderbolt 3 support even though the processor supports it, but most people will be fine without it.\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE (4/5):\r\n\r\nThis Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 is equipped with a quad-core Intel Core i7-8565U with 8 logical threads, 8GB RAM and a SK Hynix BC501 512GB NVMe SSD with up to 1600MB/s read and 860 MB/s write. This Dell delivers excellent performance that many people will be happy with.\r\n\r\nGiven that it only uses Intel UHD Graphics 620, you won’t be doing much in the way of gaming on this machine. 2D titles may fair well, but many modern titles will certainly struggle. That being said, it should handle viewing 4K videos, although the display is only 1080p. Using an external display that supports 4K should not be an issue.\r\n\r\nBIOMETRICS (5/5):\r\n\r\nThe fingerprint sensor on this Dell is made by Goodix. From my experience, this fingerprint sensor is as reliable as the fingerprint sensor you’d find on a modern smartphone—and that’s actually amazing. Some so-called ‘premium’ 2-in-1 laptops use fingerprint sensors from Synaptics, which are unreliable and sometimes don’t even register touches. This Goodix fingerprint sensor has yet to fail on me. Using this fingerprint sensor, I can very reliably unlock the computer with Windows Hello. This is the best fingerprint sensor I’ve used on a laptop, and I hope that other manufacturers will follow suit in ensuring a reliability like Dell has.\r\n\r\nBATTERY (5/5):\r\n\r\nThe Inspiron’s battery should get most people through a full day under lighter workloads. With mixed usage and pushing the display brightness and speaker volume up, your results may vary more, depending on your usage patterns. Heavy video viewing will likely require charging. The device charges via the DC power adapter OR through the USB-C port. I’ve used third-party USB-C chargers as well as USB-C docks to charge this laptop. I do like that you have the choice between DC or USB-C charging, unlike some laptops which only charge through one or the other. Having more options is better!\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3/5):\r\n\r\nAll things considered, this machine functions as a 2-in-1 in that it reliably serves its purpose. Its display is decent and bright with a responsive touch screen, and the pen input is reliable. Build quality is not premium, but is sturdy enough that I wouldn’t expect it to break on me too easily. That being said, I feel as this product’s price should change to reflect the lack of quality control. While it functions as a reliable machine, there are many 2-in-1 laptops that are cheaper with similar specs and build quality. The fact that this Inspiron’s price is nearing that of premium notebooks with better quality control is unsettling for me. As a result, I recommend you save a couple hundred dollars and look elsewhere.', ""The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 has a fast Intel Core i7-8565U 4-core / 8-thread CPU and an exceptionally fast PC SN520 NVMe WDC 512GB SSD, combined with 8GB SODIMM DDR4 clocked @ 2400 MHz ram and Intel UHD Graphics 620. See attached UserBenchmark screenshots for benchmark details.\r\n\r\nThe fast CPU and SSD make this a great system for productivity tasks like browsing the web, working on a spreadsheet, editing a document in Word, running an application with lots of calculations, or moving files around. Surfing the web on this machine is lightning fast, and there literally is no noticeable transition lag when loading long scrolling web pages like a news site or Facebook. I'd have to say this is the fastest internet browsing experience I've encountered on a desktop or laptop to date, and I was quite impressed! \r\n\r\nThe screen has ample room, is crystal clear, and has very small bezel edges. The touchscreen response is ultra-smooth, and the large trackpad has a great feel with a slight texture to provide a little bit of tactile resistance, as opposed to the completely slippery surface some touchpads come with, which I find annoying. Using this 2-in-1 in tablet mode, or just reaching out and using your fingers to do gestures on the touchscreen is very handy and becomes second nature.\r\n\r\nThe touchscreen also has Active Pen Support, so I can use my pen from my Surface Pro with this laptop! Very nice bonus feature for anyone that uses their Surface pen for drawing.\r\n\r\nThe build quality is quite good and has a premium feel to it with the brushed aluminum top. It feels very solid in the lap, and there isn't any play in the hinge when using it in laptop mode. The screen doesn't bounce at all, which is nice. I find that sometimes happens with the 2-in-1's, and it gets annoying after a while.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard is backlit, which is very important to me, and has 2 levels of brightness, which is enough. I do think they could've gone a little larger on the keyboard as there is plenty of room on the sides, and it seem a little cramped when using in the lap with your arms reaching inward to the keys. The chiclet keys are decent and have a good tactile resistance to them. There isn't a number pad on this laptop, so that could be an issue for some productivity uses like spreadsheets. Wireless external numpads are cheap, so not a deal breaker I'd say.\r\n\r\nThe laptop has a decent port selection for a thin laptop, with HDMI, USB-C, audio, 2 USB 3 ports, and a SD card reader slot. There isn't a network port, but those are becoming less common on slim devices like this one. It would've increased the thickness to put one on the side, for sure.\r\n\r\nThe laptop scored quite poorly with regards to 3D gaming, as to be expected without a discrete GPU, and the Intel 620 onboard graphics, but it can handle some games on lower settings for casual play. I play World of Warcraft, and it handled this acceptably in the 20-30 fps range on lower settings for the occasional travelling gaming session in a hotel. Casual internet games that just use 2D should work just fine. 2D performance is really fast.\r\n\r\nThe speakers are located on the lower side edges near the front where your hands rest and have plenty of volume and a nice sound to them. Listening to some Google Play music on them as I type this review with the laptop in my lap and the sound comes through just fine. With the space on each side of the keyboard, I'm surprised the speakers weren't placed there. Plenty of volume comes out of the speakers for my taste. Should be plenty for most, I'd imagine for a laptop.\r\n\r\nI've been using the fingerprint reader to unlock the laptop, and I have to say that is pretty nice! Every now and then it won't recognize my fingerprint, but I think it's learning more locations over time, because it seems to be recognizing it more, the more I use it. Setting it up was pretty easy, and part of the setup options when first setting up the laptop.\r\n\r\nBattery life seems to be in the 6.5 to 9-hour range depending on how much you toggle the performance of the machine. You can adjust the power settings from best battery life to best performance using a 4-position slider utility, as well as brighten or dim the screen and backlit keyboard. With the performance slider one slot above best battery life, and the screen around 60% brightness and backlit keys on, I saw about 6.5 hours of mostly web browsing activity with some video / audio clip watching. When I adjusted this to best battery saving, lowered the brightness to 40% and turned off the backlit keys, it was a bit over 8 hours. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a great 2-in-1 with plenty of speed and fast SSD performance. The 8 GB of memory will handle most applications you throw at it, and with the exceptionally fast SSD, even if the laptop must use disk caching it is going to handle it with ease. Pen support is awesome! I will most likely order an additional 8 GB memory for this and install it, taking it to 16 GB memory.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend to a friend or colleague. Great job, Dell!"", 'Setup of this laptop was very simple and straight forward. From an aesthetic standpoint, I really appreciate the slim lines and ""low profile"". Of course, Also, the machine is lightweight and easily transportable in a backpack, purse, or even a large purse. This unit literally runs in a low profile mode since it is silent with its solid state components. \r\n\r\nI personally like the 2 in 1 feature so that it can be used either as a laptop or a tablet and the touch screen feature is easily executable. It would have been nice to have Dell include a pen for this 2 in 1 because some manufacturers do include that as part of the package. I am not a gamer so I cannot evaluate the speed meant for that functions. However, the screen resolution is high and defined, crystal clear. Since I am a CPA by trade, it would have been a nice design item to have a 10 key pad since there is plenty of room for it, but only a CPA would think in those terms.\r\n\r\nI have read the negative reviews for this unit on Best Buy\'s website. I received this machine about 5 months ago, but since I have other numerous desktop devices because of my profession, this laptop is not a day to day device for me, rather it is when I go on vacation and need something mobile, but bigger than a smartphone to load pictures on, keep up with email, and use the internet.', 'The Inspiron laptop line has been for years reliable workhorses for every day home/school use.\r\nThe line keeps improving and this late 2018 model has plenty of welcome changes.\r\nThe top and bottom covers are now made of aluminum and the housing is made of brushed metal, the screen is a seamless piece of glass. The touchpad is large, accepts multi-finger gestures and it\'s very responsive. Something odd is that the trackpad, instead of being a smooth surface, it\'s slightly rough. It seems that Dell chose to make it look nice with a metallic texture instead of providing a smooth surface expected in a trackpad. I don\'t see it as a big deal, but it\'s something I immediately noticed the first time I used it and every time I go back to it after using other laptops.\r\nThe screen is touchscreen and accepts active pens (not included), and has 360 degrees hinges that folds as a tablet. The system works well and the screen stays in place.\r\nThe keyboard has recessed island keys with good feedback, and good amount of travel for a laptop keyboard. The keys are lighted, with off/med/max settings. It does not have a number pad, which is actually something I prefer because the keys are centered instead of having to type on the left side because of the number pad that I\'d rarely use.\r\nOn the left it has a round power plug, a small charge LED, an USB-C port that also has DisplayPort and charge the laptop, a full-size HDMI port that supports HDMI 2.0 (For 4K TVs), and audio jack. To the right there are two USB 3.1 ports and an SD card reader.\r\nThe screen is 1080x1920 (Full HD), and it\'s very clear to read or to watch videos (Cinema Display, with good blacks and contrast), and it\'s touchscreen, as it can be folded as a tablet.\r\nAudio is OK for a laptop, comes from the sides on the bottom.\r\n\r\nSomething I noticed is that it\'s much simpler to service than other new laptops: The bottom shell can be easily removed with Philips screws. The battery can be replaced with some screws (No glued components) and there are two DDR4 memory slots (This model has 8 GB, so one slot is 8 GB and the other is empty). The SSD is NVMe and also removable.\r\nThere is also a slot for a 2.5"" SATA drive (SSD or spinning disk), and it comes with the cable and everything else that\'s required to install one.\r\nThe CPU is an 8th gen i7, which is quite responsive while multitasking, and if you\'re looking for a laptop to keep for a few years, this is the type of CPU to consider.\r\nThe battery should last the whole day, although there\'s a lot of space inside dedicated to the empty drive slot.\r\nThe NVMe is noticeably fast. We have similar laptop, 2017 model with similar CPU, more RAM and a standard disk. This machine is already done booting and waiting for the login when the laptop with the standard disk is just starting to show the boot logo. The Laptop has a TPM (Encryption) module 2.0, so now Windows encrypts the hard drive by default, even with Windows Home.\r\nThe laptop has a web camera that is much smaller than previous models, and unlike previous Windows 10 laptops, doesn\'t support the Windows Hello login using the camera with face recognition. Instead, the power button is also a fingerprint sensor. It\'s recognized by Windows Hello (Windows 10 personalized login system).\r\nIn my opinion, the fingerprint sensor works more reliably and faster than face recognition cameras. It works much like a smartphone.\r\n\r\nWhile the screen is nice, CPU and SSD are very fast, the video controller is an Intel 620, which is OK for videos and casual games (Other Inspirion models have discrete graphics while costing noticeably more). Also there is a single USB-C and doesn\'t support thunderbolt 3 accessories.\r\nAlso, while the laptop can be charged using an USB-C laptop charger, it comes with a round plug charger. Having an extra USB-C instead of the old dell charging connector would\'ve been better.', ""I am officially a born-again Windows user. I was on the “other” side for roughly the last 15 years and have finally gotten tired of the proprietary ecosystem in which I was forced to subscribe. This is my first Windows 10 laptop and for the most part, I am very excited to once again, be on the right side of the fence. While this laptop is everything most consumers would ever need, there are also a few shortcomings, based on package and price point, that should be considered.\r\n\r\nFirst, we’ll start with some really cool things that I love about the Inspiron…\r\n\r\nHaving the ability to use an Active Pen (not included) to draw, scroll, and even edit photos in Photoshop, is a really, really nice feature. If you flip the screen over into tablet mode, you can basically edit photos as if you were using a dedicated tablet/pen, only directly on the screen instead of at the side. No more need for an external device! This is huge for retouching skin in Photoshop. Very cool indeed. The touch screen interface has worked flawlessly for me. Think tablet, only directly on your screen. I am surprised that not all laptops offer a touch screen at this point. Cleaning the screen is also very easy if you find you’ve gotten a lot of fingerprints on it. Just use a microfiber cloth.\r\n\r\nThe Windows 10 software has taken me a few days to get used to, but I am finding it to be more intuitive and functional than “the other guys.” You can get way deeper into the system, exploring settings and customizing until your heart's content. If that isn’t your thing, or you are a casual user, I also believe the Windows 10 system is very functional, elegant, and easy to learn and use right out of the box. The touchscreen along with Windows 10 is a great match and seems to be designed as such.\r\n\r\nThe inputs on this laptop are perfect for my lifestyle. As a photographer that shoots in the field a lot, having an SD card reader and a USB C port is all I really need. I can download and back up my files through the built in card reader, directly onto my external USB C SSD drive at very fast transfer speeds. Having an HDMI out is also nice for viewing slideshows and video projects directly onto an external computer display, my smart TV’s at home, or in an office anywhere.\r\n\r\nBluetooth has paired seamlessly with all of my devices, including all of my BT headphones. On a recent trip, I had this on the plane and was watching shows I downloaded from Netflix with my active noise cancelling BT headphones, and it was superb. No glitches in audio, or video whatsoever. \r\n\r\nAfter researching several models from several manufacturers, I settled on a DELL and am glad I did. I have found it very easy to register and update my DELL so far. They have been around for some time and have garnered a great reputation, which was another reason I went with this laptop. I haven’t had to use any customer service, so I cannot report on that.\r\n\r\nMiddle of the road…\r\n\r\nWhile I do love the aluminum build quality and 2 in 1 foldability of this laptop, the screen is actually one of the shortcomings. When I have a wallpaper showing that has a lot of black, I can see a defect at the top of my screen where there is light coming in at the edge. To simulate how this looks, if you have a black wallpaper color on your screen and you touch the screen with your finger or the Pen and some pressure, you will see the screen get brighter around the point of impact. This is how it looks at the edge of my screen at all times. Granted it is not a huge area, it is still there. Being very thin, the screen also has quite a bit of flex, making me think that it isn’t the toughest computer screen, so I would recommend adding a Best Buy protection plan at purchase. The screen is also only 1920x1080. At this price point, I think it would be nicer to have included the 4K screen as standard. With the 4K screen you will get much better text and a lot more real estate for photo and video editing purposes. While the text looks good on this screen and has certainly come a long way for Windows based machines, it is still not as sharp as I would prefer.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the screen (if yours is flawless) does look really nice for a standard HD monitor compared to the competition. Rich and vibrant colors. My wallpapers all pop out of the screen.\r\n\r\nRAM is another issue, but only if you are trying to use it for intensive applications like video editing software, or ultra high end gaming. For a standard user, 8GB is all you would need for everyday normal “coffee shop” use.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I am very happy with this as my first Windows laptop. I am also happy that I chose DELL. Could it be better? Yes. The same can be said about a lot of tech available these days. Ultimately, if you are wanting a great package that looks nice, will allow you to surf the web, play some games, stream content, Netflix and chill, get school work done, etc… This is a great PC. \r\n\r\nAs always, I would recommend purchasing a protection plan for any tech you buy. It is a great add-on and will protect you from any problems that may arise, whether it is a manufacturer defect, or user error.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\nAffordable\r\nActive Pen ready (not included)\r\n2 in 1 foldability\r\nAluminum body\r\n1 x USB 3.1 Type-C \r\n2 x USB 3.1 (standard)\r\nHDMI out\r\nSD Card Reader\r\nInternal SSD\r\n8th Generation Intel Core i7\r\nBluetooth works great\r\n\r\nCons: \r\nWindows 10 Home pre-installed, not Pro\r\nNo 4K screen (3840x2160)\r\nScreen resolution only 1920x1080\r\nScreen issue at top of screen (described above)\r\nText not as sharp as 4K or Retina display\r\nNot fast enough for native 4K video editing\r\nShared graphics memory\r\nOnly 8GB RAM\r\nActive Pen not included\r\nExcessive bloatware installed"", 'This is a great laptop to have whether for your personal use or for school. I like that it’s a tablet and a laptop in one, especially the touchscreen. This is my third in the past several years and the only issue I have is that I wish I could get something to protect the screens. That’s the reason why I had to upgrade each time I did. The screens cracked and I wanted to upgrade even though they were still functioning great. It’s a little on the expensive side but worth it.', '')"

The laptop was delivered on 07/04/2019. It was an open-box, according to model: ""Open Box - Dell - Inspiron 13.3"" 4K Ultra HD Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD + Optane - Black Model: I7390-7100BLK-PUS SKU: 6339272\nCondition: Certified "".\nThe computer was received by my sister, who was vacationing in Orlando. On 07/14/2019 my sister returned to Brazil and gave me the computer. From the beginning I noticed that he had a small scratch on the screen and also one near the keyboard. I am very disappointed with Best Buy, because even though I knew it was an open-box, I believed that it was at the Excellent level (Open-Box Excellent - Certified). Despite the sadness, I decided to turn on the computer. Everything seemed fine and I started to do the Windows configurations. However, when I was on the screen to put the wifi network, the computer simply shut down. I thought it was the power plug, but I checked and it was working. I turned on again and restarted the settings and again it hung up. I repeated the process several times until I was able to configure Windows. I started using windows and again it shut down. I noticed that it is getting very hot and that the cooler makes a lot of noise. I believe that the shut down should have something to do with it. I tested it in ""cabin"" mode with the nearby air conditioner and managed to leave it agum time without turning off. However, when I put it in normal mode it shut down in less than 5 minutes. Unfortunately I live in the state of Amazon, Brazil, and I have no idea what could be done. I would really appreciate your help. I\'m very regret I bought the open-box. I believe it would have been much better to buy the band new version. Please help me find a solution for this.', 'The sales representative knew her subject matter.  We were able to select a 2-in-1 laptop that we used to replace an older laptop.

So all in all paid $600 for this bad boy with a two year warranty. \n\nmyPROS: At $550 the specs are unmatched, the 4k display is gorgeous, the stylus is nifty, keyboard and touchpad is good, and processor runs snappy\nmyCons: battery life realistically 3-5hrs-general 7hrs-max It would be perfect if it was FHD1080p and had 7hrs of general use. \nThe fan runs alot and machine runs hot. I would have returned but its not as bad after bios update and taking out the bloatware. \nThe speakers are meh could have been better. \n\nOverall, i would not pay $1100 for this machine maybe $750 brand new because of the poor battery life and how it runs hot/fan's constantly on BUT @ $550 its a no-brainer \n\nMy advice: check your local bestbuy to see if they have these open box and check the condition. If you find a good one then extend your warranty another year for $50 at Dell That way you'll have a 2 year warranty."", '')"

Rather than borrowing one from a family member, or buying a crappy one to get by, I thought this one had all the specs I might need for a future career. This laptop worked great up until the New Year when the touchscreen began to show mysterious contact points. Multiple windows opened and when the internet loaded, multiple website links were clicked in such rapid succession that I was powerless to stop it. When the battery finally died, I recharged it then restarted it without the glitch. After a few moments it happened again! I managed to shut it down and restart before the ""ghost tapping"" took over, and disabled the touch screen. I had forgotten about the feature until today, 2 months later, and enabled it to see what would happen. Within a few minutes, the screen went haywire again, opening windows, zooming in on others.

The inside of the laptop has a brushed stainless look, and feel to it, and it's really quite striking. The outside is a more flat silver. The hardware all seems very high quality - especially the hinges. I am sure they will stand up to years of opening, closing, and folding the laptop with no issues. The backlit keyboard is also a nice touch as it's become somewhat of a requirement for me these days.\r\nThe performance of this computer is also outstanding.

The fan is quiet and while the laptop did get warm with intense usage, it wasn’t burning hot.\r\n\r\nProcessing power has been adequate and should be able to handle everything except graphics intensive applications like gaming or autocad.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t the most exciting laptop I’ve used, but it does get the job done for most intents and purposes. I would have liked to have seen an active pen included in the box and a webcam cover, but otherwise it’s a pretty worthy 2-in-1 laptop.', ""Got this laptop about a week ago and have been putting it through the paces. First off, I really like the sleek and slim design. To me, it's like a Windows version of a MacBook Air based on the fit/finish and weight (was 3.10 lb on my lab scale).\r\n\r\nInitial setup was a breeze as expected. Really fast speed too! Geekbench 4 trial came in at 4468/15162 which was really impressive for this CPU. After all the long Windows 10 updates, I've been browsing, Microsoft Office apps, photo editing, and little bit of Autodesk Inventor through a few battery cycles. Depending on my activities, I'm getting from a solid 4 hours to about 6 1/2 hours on a full charge.\r\n\r\nI really like the Touch ID power button. So much faster when logging into the machine! I played around with the touch screen in tablet mode, but really, I prefer my iPad for that and will likely use this more as a traditional laptop. Maybe fold back when watching a long video or something. But 3+ lb as a tablet actually gets a little tiring on the wrist.\r\n\r\nThe screen is really clear and I crank it to high resolution and can still read very clearly. I prefer the glossy screen as well (I know many people don't). Keyboard and track pad, to me, are very comfortable and responsive. Windows customizations work great for gestures and scroll direction. And in the BIOS I toggled the FN keys.\r\n\r\nAnyway, great laptop for general and some light CAD use!"", 'Over my 30 year IT career, I\'ve had the chance to work with dozens of laptops and ultrabooks - each having their own strength\'s and weaknesses. This Dell 2-1 is very strong in most categories - performance, durability, weight, usability, etc but lacks two things.\r\n\r\n1. Why did Dell not include an Active Stylus with this device? One of the main reasons I got a 2 in 1 is to work better on Webex presentations - so I can draw concepts and ideas more easily and accurately. Once I purchase a pen ($50-80), I can update the review but would have liked Dell to include one and make it magnetic (like the Surface) so I have a place to store it.\r\n2. Three sides of the very nice screen have ""narrow borders"". I pretty much expect all devices to have an edge-to-edge display. The bottom margin is nearly 1 1/4"" which to me is an incredible waste of screen space. I\'m disappointed with this.\r\n\r\nOther than that - it\'s been a solid performing device. Touchscreen is responsive to my fingertips, fingerprint reader works well, touch pad is accurate and quick. Battery life is decent for a 3-cell battery but you\'ll usually need to carry the charger in your bag. The speakers are underneath on the left and right sides near the front and actually sound pretty good for the location and size.\r\n\r\nThe 360 degree feature is cool - and prompts you to go into tablet mode while also disabling the keyboard at the same time. I\'m getting used to using this - but will take time.\r\n\r\nPrimarily - this will be my travel laptop - much easier to work on an airplane with this versus a bigger 15"" or 17"" laptop. The backlit keyboard will allow me to work without interrupting the next person next to me in the airplane without turning on the overhead light.\r\n\r\nI too had an Microsoft Windows activation problem initially, but it went away upon my second try. I signed in with my O365 account and installed the apps - and was rolling in no time at all!\r\n\r\nOverall - highly recommended but purchase an Active Stylus if you want to draw.', '')"

First of all, I purchased this laptop in order to work from home after I had back surgery. When I first purchased the laptop, I set it up with no issues, and then it sat for about 15 days while I prepared for surgery and recovered for a week. On April 10th, the laptop wont connect to WIFI and tells me ""The intel wireless AC Adapter is experiencing driver or hardware related problems."" So I googled it, but couldn\'t figure out what the problem was. Then I called Geek Squad at the Puyallup, WA location. I was told to bring it in as it needed to be replaced. I then went to the store and waited as the IT tech worked on the computer. After 20 minutes, after attempting to install updates and drivers, it still would not work. He swapped out the computer for a new one and I asked him to help me set it up. Afterwards, I leave and do some work from home for a few hours, Then I notice its almost dead on 3 %. I check different outlets to no avail. I called back Geek Squad and spoke to the same tech who helped me earlier. He said ""Sometimes there\'s lemons,"" The laptop dies. I bring it back to best buy to geek squad and the same tech checks the adapter. He said he didn\'t think to check it earlier because it was brand new out of the box. This is my second time coming back to the store post-surgery. I was handed the charger I brought in earlier. I asked to speak to a manager and the IT tech said ""hes just going to tell you the same thing I am."" Excuse me? He said \'theyre all busy right now."" Again, that\'s not what I asked. At this point I\'m angry. The manager comes out and takes care of the situation and resolves the matter. Then I go home to plug the dead computer in and i will not move off the Dell screen. I wait and wait, restart it multiple times, and call Geek squad back. The same IT tech answers and tells me ""we close in 5 minutes."" So I have to race back up there. The manager attempts to fix the computer and cannot. At this point its after close and he tells me he will match the price for a comparable computer. I looks around, and he shows me a few models. Obviously I\'m not choosing Dell (mind you I have only bought Dells since 2006) and he explains the Lenovo he wouldn\'t be able to match the price on. There were no other comparable options, and I ended up having to pay $400+ out of pocket for the difference because ""it wouldn\'t let him do any better"" for going back and forth to Best buy while being out of a computer. I filed a complaint this morning. I want to know why Dell is producing these laptops and shipping them into Best Buy. As one consumer, I should not have received 2 $1000 laptops and not been able to use them. I want a response from Dell, from BestBuy, and I want a refund for the $400+.

Overall I love it!', ':: The Search.\r\n\r\nI\'ve spent about a week researching laptops to replace my long dead XPS 17"" from back in the dark ages of 2012, and I have become somewhat of an expert on laptops from various manufacturers. This time I wanted something smaller and much more mobile with the intent on using it primarily for getting away from home, away from the internet, and focus solely on my writing and digital art. I intend on creating my graphic novel with this machine.\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of headaches from my research, going back and forth between reviews on websites, and watching countless videos on YouTube, I ended up purchasing this laptop, which I might add is the Inspiron 7000 13"" 8th Gen Intel, 7386 model released Oct. 2018 (for some reason this costs hundreds MORE on Dell.com vs. Bestbuy.com).\r\n\r\nJust some quick out-of-the-way points:\r\n\r\n- It comes with 16GB, but you CANNOT upgrade the RAM on this year/model, but you CAN upgrade the M.2 PCIe SSD. Since I use ""the cloud"" for files and entertainment, storage is not an issue; the M.2 SSD speed is fast.\r\n- It has a full 4k 60Hz screen (Windows 10 default is set to 300% zoom which can be changed back to 100%), excellent wide viewing angles and it can get really bright in a sun-in-your-face kind of way without washing out the colors. The image quality and overall quality of the screen is quite unbelievable. Very excellent pixel density.\r\n- This DID come with an Active Pen (basic - white). The original page details didn\'t include that it came with one, so I bought the Premium pen from Dell (black), and because of that I never used the included pen. However the Premium pen from Dell works flawlessly, it\'s smooth and it feels very good when gripping.\r\n- Screen drawing with the Pen is surprisingly very nice, it feels natural, and works well with Photoshop and Krita.\r\n- The ""real-life"" battery life is not bad, nor great. Even turning down the brightness, turning off Bluetooth, WiFi, and just typing might provide about 5 hours of battery life (about 3 hours using Photoshop or Krita), but still much more than my Macbook Pro. \r\n- I am having an issue when closing the laptop lid, it remains on and it drains the battery (might be a settings issue, I just can\'t seem to find it). And it\'s inconsistent, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\'t. I have to turn it off all the way to save power, but right now it\'s not an issue since it boots up very quickly.\r\n\r\n:: The Experience.\r\n\r\nFirst I have to say that the pictures do not do it justice. It actually looks slimmer and smaller in person than it does in the pictures. Some of the pictures made it look chunkier and more rounded off on the corners than I\'d like, but aesthetically speaking, seeing it in person is very pleasing once you unbox it and hold it in front of you. For the first few days I didn\'t want to touch it much because I didn\'t want to ruin it with fingerprints, smudges and dust. But I had to use it right?\r\n\r\nA 13"" inch laptop in my opinion is perfect. I had some doubts that it would not be big enough screen wise, but I was wrong and this is just excellent. The low profile, low bezel look is most excellent. In the dark, it almost looks like an XPS and it\'s very comparable to the XPS in style.\r\n\r\nThis laptop is very compact, it\'s 3 pounds light (but still feels hefty), the build quality is really good, it doesn\'t feel like its made up of cheap plasticky parts. The keys are backlit and you can choose from lights on, to brighter lights, to completely off. The keys have a good feel to them, and in my opinion much nicer than the Macbook Pro\'s keys. The spacing is good and the responsiveness is good. The track pad physically looks and feels nice, but it\'s easy to get lost when moving around and clicking (or tapping once on the main pad to simulate a click). Since I have a small Bluetooth mouse, I haven\'t used the track pad much.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a 2-In-1, the hinges are pretty tough, so trying to open this with one hand isn\'t an easy task, but if you\'re like me, you\'ll try to find a way to open it with as little fingers as possible to avoid smudging it. It\'s a bit annoying at first but you\'ll get over it. :p \r\n\r\nUsing it as a Tablet is about what you\'d expect it to be, just a very thick tablet with a super nice screen. The keys are disabled when you flip it so you don\'t have to worry about accidentally pressing them and causing issues. Flipping it in the tent position is very useful for when you\'re drawing, as if it were a dedicated drawing tablet. And it works well in the kitchen while cooking and watching video tutorials.\r\n\r\nThe built-in audio is really good for something this small. I expected below average tiny sound, but it actually has some range, and a bit of a kick to it -- a has more bass than I expected it to have. Overall it provides very clear, clean audio.\r\n\r\n:: Real World Use.\r\n\r\nSetting it up was a breeze, you get the standard Cortana introduction with Windows 10, you can set up the fingerprint scanner (which works very well) and you can set a Password and a PIN as backups. Right away I went from unboxing it, awe-ing it, to actually using it. Of course early on I did all the updates I could to make sure it was at it\'s best, and that wasn\'t an issue either. \r\n\r\nWhen I got setup, I installed some important apps such as Scrivener (1.9) for writing, Adobe Photoshop CC and Krita 4. These apps, which can be intensive, all perform very well on this Inspiron, much better than I expected it. Although I almost got a cheaper unit since I mostly intend on writing, I felt it was worth the extra money for the art I needed to produce. Just note that an issue with Scrivener 1.9 and newer laptops, causing them to freeze up or lag, is not the laptop\'s fault. I talked to the Scrivener support and the problem is that the old (current 1.9) Windows version uses an old version of ""QT"" that is no longer updated, Scrivener\'s Fullscreen uses this, but I can confirm that Scrivener Beta 3 fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nThe 2-in-1 feature, turning it into a tablet or even a drawing tablet, I originally thought was going to be a gimmick, however just one quick drawing session changed my mind permanently. Now I am wondering how in the world I was able to live without such a feature. For awhile I was exploring buying an expensive drawing tablet such as a Wacom Cintiq, however I could never justify buying one simply to attach it to a Mac or PC and work on it as only an extended monitor to draw on. But I did want a draw-on-screen tablet, so I thought the investment, just a few hundred more compared to the non 2-in-1, would be worth it if it worked, and not a great loss if it didn\'t (after all I would still have a powerful useful laptop). I am glad I made this decision. Excellent drawing screen. I also mulled my options on a 13"" vs 15"" or 17"". For me, I can say that 13"" is perfect. Not too small as I thought it would be, but not too big and cumbersome to deal with when it comes to drawing.\r\n\r\nI have not used the camera, or the SD Card, USB ports and Headphone jack, but I have used Bluetooth on it with a wireless mouse and the performance is flawless; also the WiFi connectivity is flawless as well. \r\n\r\nAfter playing around with this laptop for about a week, and even taken it on an away trip, I can say that I am loving this more and more, and in fact I love it way more than any Macbook Pro I ever had. It looks nicer, it performs better, and it has better features. And this is coming from someone who grew up on Macs all his life, and still uses them at work for Web Application Development.\r\n\r\n:: Conclusion.\r\n\r\nI would 110% recommend this Dell Inspiron 7000 13"" (7386) to anyone, coming from the perspective of an Apple user, a Web App Developer, a 20-year IT Tech Veteran, a 3D modeler, a Writer and soon-to-be Graphic Novel Artist. It\'s a stylish, beautiful and very functional piece of tech. I only wish I could afford a second one for my wife. Perhaps in due time, unless Santa Dell wants to surprise me this Xmas. :)', 'Overall it is a Dell. The screen is clear and crisp and the thing is fast, blazing fast. I really liked the fingerprint sensor in the power button and it works well unless you have anything, I mean anything at all, on your finger. The battery life is great as long as you stay in power saving mode about 6-7 hours continual run time for office based tasks, but take that off and it goes dead in about 45 minutes. At full throttle the thing gets hot and the fans kick in quickly but stay pretty quiet. Overall a good buy for something with this much power.\r\n\r\nOn a note: I had to play with the charging settings in the BIOS right out of the box because it continually said the battery was low. It would not charge up because it was trying to do smart charging, which I think is a bit of a useless feature because it was not charging the battery all the way.', 'The features of the laptop are good. Configuration seems good and screen size is one of the best part.', 'This laptop had a lot going for it. \r\n\r\nSmall, lightweight, great build quality, great screen, nice keyboard, great specs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the cons were enough to warrant a return for me.\r\n\r\nThe fan was constantly running and got quite loud at times. \r\nWhen i first unboxed the laptop and booted up windows for the first time, the fan started blaring not one minute into the process. \r\n\r\nThe other big con is the battery life.

6212813 ,"(""My first Dell laptop and so far I am thinking it won't be my last. I purchased this laptop on sale. \r\n\r\nFor the cost, without the sale it is still cheaper than what Dell sells on website. With the sale it is honestly an amazing value. \r\n\r\nIt is extremely fast with the quad core AMD Ryzen 7 and 12GB dual channel ddr4 RAM and 256GB ssd. These specs are very good and at the current price you won't find a better deal anywhere than BestBuy! \r\n\r\nNot only are the specs on paper nice but the laptop feels sturdy and well built. The screen is bright and very nice with a glass touchscreen. The sound is good with the only concern being bottom firing. The backlit keys have two light settings and turn off when not in use. \r\n\r\nThe laptop has plenty of ports and has an all aluminum build. I just got the PC so I haven't had a chance to test battery life completely but so far it seems to go about 5-6 hours heavy use and with the settings and brightness tweaked it should go to 8 hours. \r\n\r\nThe keyboard is responsive and feels good. \r\n\r\nOverall my initial impressions are very good. This is an awesome device. Also because it has the AMD Ryzen 7 it is close to the latest gen core i7 from Intel but the integrated Vega 10 graphics are about double to triple the performance of Intel and close to the Nvidia mx150 dedicated graphics card. You can play games with decent settings on this laptop. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend it to anyone. I don't understand the negative reviews. Try this for yourself and if you are on the fence just go for it!!"", ""10 days after purchase, we've now had three Dell technicians remotely try their magic, but the wireless card keeps disappearing. I'm attaching two photos...\r\nMy son needs to take this to college, so I think we're going to return it. \r\n\r\nI'm connected right now though, at least long enough to write this review...."", ""The hate is strong for this one.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using this as my desktop replacement. I added a wireless mouse and wired keyboard. And use an external monitor.\r\n\r\nLots of storage 256 gb with 12 gb of RAM. This notebook/ tablet/desktop should last me in particular a long time.\r\n\r\nA complainer mentioned the noise of the fan. The fan noise is audible when doing any gaming. And that's why I would give this product a 4.5 star review if I could. While web browsing or watching YouTube videos... if the fan is on I cant hear it.\r\n\r\nI didn't have any luck finding a case that I think would adequately protect this product while maintaining mobility and ventilation of internal fans.\r\n\r\nConsidering everything this tablet/notebook/desktop is capable of and the PRICE it's offered at... I could easily rate this as a 5 star product."", ""So, for $699 I picked this up. The price was different in store compared to their app so I get the adjustment. Hours later the price is now +100 so yay me. Also, to have a AMD Ryzen 7 2400u with a 12GB and a 256 SSD for this price is just insane. Not an M2 SSD drive but I'm not working on it, this is for fun. After all updates including the BIOS firmware update and all scans, this laptop sits quietly and I do not hear the fan so I don't know what those comments are about. I do head the fan when the processor is working hard but it's not annoying. The nic is fast. The touch screen is great and if you poke it, it does not wobble like some of the other 2 in 1's I tested. The Asus was the best at this test, didn't even move a centimeter. This one moved ever so slightly but doesn't rubber band. Can't complain because I cannot believe I scored such a solid and packed laptop. I hope my nic doesn't die like I read the other reviewer said. I'm done with Lenovo because of that. Had the entire board die just after the 2 year warranty. This is my first Dell. Wish me luck!\r\n\r\nOnly complaint is the power adapter. I can totally see this thing not lasting long however it's fine now and the plug in to the laptop, if one isn't careful I can see it easily snapping off if clipped accidentally. I don't know why manufacturers don't improve such a major component of a laptop. The Surface Pro has a pretty cool power plug. I think that would be a great addition."", 'Just picked up this laptop on the recommendation of the Best Buy worker. Based on what my needs were it for the criteria perfectly.

What's worse, this week the fps drop to about 40 periodically. First I thought it was caused by the update of the graphic driver. But right now I reinstall the old version. The experience remains the same. It was definitely the automatic underclocking."", ""Build Quality:\r\nIt’s a solid laptop, the hinge although not the standard dual hinge is still solid. The plastic case while not a good as say the aluminum ones like MSI or Asus it is more than enough if you are not going to abuse it. \r\n\r\nInput:\r\nThe keyboard is decent and while it's not a gaming mechanical one for a laptop its not bad. The blue back lighting is nice as it's easy on the eyes and makes gaming at night in the dark easy. They added an extra nub on the S key so when gaming to find wasd is easy by touch also there is graphic boxes around those keys as well. The palm rest and touch pad are on par with any other midtier laptop in this price range. \r\n\r\nPorts/IO:\r\nThe power is on the right-hand side and that’s a plus however like all dell systems it’s a straight plug and I can see over time if you are not careful putting undue stress on the power port and causing the solder connections to come loose causing it to not charge. This is not all that uncommon, and a right-angled adaptor would have been nice given its location. \r\n\r\nIO on this laptop is good you not only get the standard USB 3 type A ports there is also a USB 3.1 type C, SD Card, RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet as well as HDMI, headphone and a lock slot to round it out. I would have like to have seen a mini display port for connection to a monitor but more on that later. \r\n\r\nDisplay & Video\r\nThe display on this laptop is ok at best, while FHD 1080p it’s only a 60Hz and not sure how you can call something a gaming laptop with only a 60Hz display. To add insult to injury there is only an HDMI connection and would have liked to see a mini display port as well to take advantage of some higher end monitors. On the plus side the 1060 MaxQ while not a full-fledged 1060 (its been clocked down for thermal reasons) is more than enough to run most AAA games at high settings and even some at ultra and still get 60+ FPS. \r\n\r\nBattery:\r\nThe G7 comes with a 56 Wh battery that will give you about 3.5 – 4.5 hours of use under normal use ie Netflix, web browsing, office productivity, etc. Now gaming you will only get about 1.5 hours before you need to find an outlet. In addition to that, you will not get peak performance out of just the battery as it can not keep up with the i7 and the 1060 running full blast. \r\n\r\nStorage:\r\nThe G7 has two options that best buy carries one comes with a single M.2 256GB SSD the other like I have is a 128GB SSD and a 1TB 5400RPM HD. Now for pure storage ie movies, word doc’s, etc the 5400RPM drive is more then enough however you will see substantial load times if you install your games to it and with only a 128GB SSD there is not much room to load games on to it either. \r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nWell, in short, there is not much, both the ram slots are populated with 8GB DDR4 SODIMMS so to upgrade to 32GB of ram would be rather costly and to replace the 128GB SSD with say a 500GB Samsung 970 will run you about $130. \r\n\r\nNetworking:\r\nThis is where the system falls apart, almost all modern gaming is online based everything from the Battle Royals’s like PUBG, Fortnite & BO4 to games like GTA, HotS, CS:GO & WoW. The built-in networking on this system just flat out sucks, I have a 1GB cable connection and have yet to see speeds over 40Mbs via WiFi. I know its not my cable because I did a google search and found page after page of the same complaint all of them have no fix from Dell for this problem. This is totally unacceptable for a performance gaming system that when is not on sale cost $1200. \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nWhile the laptop has many points in its favor from the GPU, IO, and general build quality the lack of a display over 60Hz and the networking are just too much to overcome. If these issues were addressed I would have no issues giving this a solid 4.5 stars but with these, I can’t give it any higher then a 3 star just beware of its shortcomings."", ""Overall the laptop is good, but the WiFi card just doesn't seem to work.

6212436 ,"('The Dell G7 is the successor to the Inspiron 15 7000 series and does an excellent job at improving upon the previous design aesthetic while also delivering outstanding performance for the price.\r\n\r\nBUILD:\r\nIn terms of the build and construction, the G7’s housing is primarily plastic, but has a rigidity that prevents it from feeling cheap. In terms of the aesthetic, Dell is going for a simpler, more elegant design that is unlike their Alienware series laptops. There’s very little about this laptop that screams “gamer”, and I certainly like that about it, as I’m not only just a gamer, but a software engineer. Laptops that one can use in professional situations as well as for gaming are becoming more popular nowadays, and Dell’s G7 is a solid response to that demand. But like any other laptop, I wouldn’t dare let this suffer a drop, as the build materials likely won’t prove to be resilient to abuse.\r\n\r\nDISPLAY:\r\nThe 15” 1080p IPS display is quite good on the G7. My unit has the AUO63ED panel which people online have overclocked to 100Hz and beyond (albeit at risk of warranty). Other units have had an LG display which did not achieve such overclocks. The display is matte, so you won’t suffer from tons of reflectivity, and it gets decently bright for most situations. For gamers and typical users, you will enjoy using this display.\r\n\r\nKEYBOARD:\r\nThe keyboard is one of the things about this laptop that is taking some getting used to. I’m personally accustomed to mechanical keyboards as well as chiclet keyboards. However, both other high-end laptops that I own have better key travel in my opinion, and that’s largely due to the wider spacing between the keys on the G7 as well as the minimal height on the keys. It’s not as though the G7’s keyboard is bad, but my fingers are certainly more accustomed to keys with closer travel and a slightly larger key height. The ones on the G7 are just a bit more recessed compared to what I’m used to. I do want to emphasize that these are observations and my opinions; your experience my differ from mine. Additionally, the keyboard is backlit (blue); I do wish it was white instead, as blue can be fatiguing over time, but I’m not sure if this minimal amount will result in any noticeable impact. When the backlight is on, it has two brightness modes, but there isn’t too much difference between them. The WASD keys also have blue squares around them when the keyboard is backlit, but it’s not something I noticed until just now. If they wanted it to stand out more, they should have opted for a different color like white. Another interesting note is that the keyboard backlight turns off after a minute, but will turn back on once a key is pressed. As far as I’ve seen, I don’t think there’s a way to configure this. If there was, I’d expect it to be in the UEFI/BIOS (F2 upon boot).\r\n\r\nTOUCHPAD:\r\nThe G7 has a Precision Touchpad which is decently large and has good palm rejection, as well. From my usage, it’s quite responsive to gestures as well as general usage, otherwise. One thing that I don’t like as much is that there are no separate mouse left-click/right-click buttons. It’s not a big deal, but I came from another gaming laptop that had them. The G7, in contrast, has very clicky touchpad mouse buttons which some may enjoy, and others may not. If you have to work in a quiet environment, you will tapping to click instead of pressing in the integrated buttons. Other than these nitpicks, I do enjoy using the trackpad and the gestures within Windows 10.\r\n\r\nI/O:\r\nThe G7 is equipped with some pretty standard I/O compared to most laptops in this price bracket and demographic. It has 3x USB-A 3.1, 1x USB-C 3.1 (with Thunderbolt), HDMI 2.0, a 3.5mm Headphone/Microphone combo jack, a full-size SD card slot, and an RJ45 gigabit ethernet port. I do wish some of these ports were located on the back, just below the hinge, but that kind of design hasn’t hit the mainstream yet.\r\n\r\nSTORAGE:\r\nThe model I have came equipped with a Toshiba KSG60ZM 256GB NVMe SSD which claims to support 1500 MB/s read and 760 MB/s write. If you’re used to hard drives, this will be a lovely change, but if you’re used to absolute top-tier NVMe SSD’s like I am, you may consider swapping it out. It does support both an m.2 SSD (SATA or PCIe NVMe), as well as a standard SATA 2.5” HDD/SSD. By default, this the G7 has RAID enabled in the BIOS to use the Intel Rapid Storage Technology NVMe controller drivers. If you decide to swap out this drive and use manufacturer drivers over AHCI mode, do a google search on ""SOLUTION: Switch Windows 10 from RAID/IDE to AHCI operation"". This will let you switch to AHCI without reinstalling windows.\r\n\r\nRAM:\r\nMy unit came with 8GB of RAM in total (2x4GB DIMM). This is a bit underwhelming, especially given the horsepower this machine has, otherwise. I would have liked to see 16GB. But if this product is focused on gamers, then the 2x4GB dual-channel memory configuration may have a sizeable enough impact on framerate to justify this decision. Even so, I do think 16GB is a much better choice for individuals like myself who would like to use this computer as a mobile workstation for professional purposes. In the end, I may have to shell out the additional high cost and max this machine out with 2x16GB for a total of 32GB.\r\n\r\nCPU:\r\nThe i7-8750H is overkill for most people, but I’m not most people. As a software engineer, I’ve been dying to have more cores in a laptop at this price and configuration. With a total of 12 logical threads, this laptop can do heavy multitasking like running a full suite of docker containers for an enterprise environment (assuming you have the RAM to match). If you’re a game streamer using OBS or similar software that relies on CPU, you may appreciate the extra cores; however, most games won’t benefit a whole lot from the additional cores. That may change in the future, but the majority of today’s titles won’t see improvement from the increase in core count. In general, expect solid multitasking performance. That being said, this CPU runs hot, and undervolting -0.125V using ThrottleStop or Intel XTU can achieve lower thermals—especially considering that the CPU and GPU expel hot air through the same heat pipe. Just keep in mind that undervolting is done at your own risk and is not supported by the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nGAMING:\r\nThe G7 is equipped with an Nvidia GTX 1060 Max Q. This puts it between the performance of the GTX 1050 Ti and the GTX 1060. As someone who has a custom-built desktop that is much faster than the Dell G7 (but cost way more money to do so), The G7 is really an excellent value and delivers a gaming experience that I am very satisfied with. The Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark was able to pull 60+ fps while set to the Very High preset under DX12 with exclusive fullscreen, FXAA and Vsync off at 1080p. That being said, a more stable framerate with fewer skips can be easily obtained under the “High” preset or by making your own fine-tuned adjustments. Competitive eSports games will also hit well over the 60fps mark. When pushing the graphical limits, this laptop can get loud and can take some time to cooldown after a gaming session. Proper airflow/ventilation will be important in obtaining reasonable temperatures, and undervolting the CPU can also help improve this.\r\n\r\nSOUND:\r\nAs far as the speakers are concerned, they’re decent. Definitely wish they had a subwoofer bass port to improve frequencies in that range, but that’s a sacrifice Dell chose to make in this design. That being said, I have used cheaper gaming laptops from 2017 which did have better bass response and got louder than the G7 while also maintaining clarity. I don’t think the G7 is disappointing on this front, but I\'m also not wowed by their solution. Regardless, I\'m happy enough with the solution.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe G7 is an excellent deal with few compromises compared to other laptops in a similar price bracket. I’ve mostly nitpicked in this review, but despite its few minor flaws, it’s an excellent laptop; one that I’m glad to be using and wouldn’t have issues recommending for the price. In fact, I have just ordered an even faster NVMe SSD and 32GB to make the G7 my primary mobile workstation.', 'Dell has been in the PC market for years. And they tend to make good quality desktop and laptop PCs without needing to be overly flashy. I guess that makes them more suitable to people who prefer the utilitarian style. But because Dell has been in the PC market for so long, it’s difficult to figure out what exact type and model you’re getting.\r\n\r\nThe model being reviewed here is a G7 Series 15 7588. It features an Intel Core i7 8750H processor that has 6 cores capable of 12 threads of execution. In layman terms, it means it can do more without bogging down your system. It has 8GB of RAM which should allow you to run several softwares at once. However, when it comes to gaming, more is usually better. 8GB is enough for most games today. Going forward, that may change. The 8GB of RAM is rated at DDR4 2666 or PC4 21300 and is preinstalled in 2x4GB. Upgrading the memory will mean purchasing a new set (in a pair) rather than a single. For storage, a 256GB SSD is installed using a M.2 interface. Dell’s support documentation list procedures for both M.2 and SATA drives but confusingly labels the 2.5” drive as hard drive and the M.2 as “Solid State Drive.” (Note: SSD can come in either 2.5” drive form factor using SATA interface or M.2 form factor.)\r\n\r\nThe laptop features a 15.6 inch display with a 1920x1080 resolution on a IPS panel. That display is powered by both Intel’s integrated graphics and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 “Max-Q” GPU. There is a dedicated 6GB of video memory which will allow the GPU to perform better without relying on system memory and its limited bandwidth. The performance review of the 1060 GPU will come shortly.\r\n\r\nOn the audio side, it is powered by RealTek and has stereo speakers on the front side of the laptop. However, the laptop design itself is angled so the speakers are aimed downwards. Unfortunately, the speakers aren’t all that good and doesn’t have good range on them. They’re more on the high side and the bass/lows are very lacking. (Tested using a few Beatles songs and Luv(sic) Part 2 by Nujabes) The only way to potentially get a better audio experience will be to use your own headphones, either through Bluetooth or the 3.5mm headphone jack.\r\n\r\nMoving on, the keyboard is backlit and dims after a period of inactivity. The A, S, D, W keys have additional backlit design to let users easily find these movement keys. There is a number pad to the right. But given that this is supposed to be a gaming laptop, I wonder if this is a good design decision to include it. I suppose some MOBA players can use these for shortcuts. On the top of the keyboards are your usual function keys as well as special keys. By default, the special keys are enabled by default. To use the F1 through F12, one has to press and hold down the “Fn” key first. I’m fairly certain this behavior can be changed within the laptop’s BIOS/firmware.\r\n\r\nOn the connectivity front, there is a Gigabit Ethernet port, 3 USB 3.x ports, a USB3 Type-C port with Thunderbolt, a HDMI port, and a SD Card reader. Unfortunately, I do not have any Thunderbolt devices to plug into the Type-C port to test its capability. But it is comforting to know that one can plug one to the laptop for a variety of things. The Gigabit Ethernet port worked as expected and I was able to transfer about 36GB of data from my desktop over to the laptop. The bandwidth was saturated close to its maximum speed and made transferring the entire Guild Wars 2 data file very fast. The laptop’s wireless capability is powered by Intel Wireless AC-9560, which can handle 802.11ac standards. According to the product documents on Intel’s website, it also can handle Bluetooth 5.0. For wireless networking, observed speeds topped off at around 100mbit/s.\r\n\r\nThe laptop comes preinstalled with Windows 10 Home edition. This is the lowest full edition Windows 10 one can get. But at the same time, it’s a bit disappointing. While the feature differences between Home and Pro is fairly small, one feature that could be a plus for gamers is being able to defer and delay Windows Update through Group Policy. Group Policy editing is not included in WIndows 10 Home which could have helped in managing some of the other minor annoyances in Windows 10. As expected of any laptops and pre-made desktops, it comes with some additional software preinstalled. McAfee Security is also preinstalled but I have personally opted to not set it up or removed it entirely. The very thought of needing to pay after the free subscription expires bothers me.\r\n\r\nOn the gaming department, I ran around in Guild Wars 2 on battery power. With that alone powering the GPU, it barely handles 30fps in crowded areas. Unfortunately, Guild Wars 2 is one of those games where you won’t get better framerate with a faster video card. Instead, it’s heavily reliant on how fast your processor is. Other games tested within the limited time I’ve spent with the laptop are “Ikaruga,” “Mark of the Ninja,” and “Dust: An Elysian Tail.” All of them performed great as expected due to the abundance of processing power of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060.\r\n\r\nIn terms of battery life, the laptop can get by on normal operations for 4-5 hours. In gaming, and depending on the game itself, that will knock it down even further. On the other hand, if you’re going to be gaming, your best bet is to simply plug the laptop to the AC. On battery, I was able to run Guild Wars 2 for about 30-45 minutes, plus around 30 minutes of Dust: An Elysian Tail, and a little of Mark of the Ninja and Ikaruga. This is all before the battery level got down to around 21-22%.\r\n\r\nThere are negative aspects to this gaming laptop. The built-in speakers leaves a lot to be desired. Because of this, you may end up using headphones for better audio listening. The use of Windows 10 Home instead of Windows 10 Pro restricts the user’s ability to fine tune how Windows operates, especially in the update department. And then there’s the fan. With a powerhouse graphics processor like the 1060, heat is going to be a constant issue. And to cool this GPU down, fans are necessary. There are times when it can get audibly loud. This comes as no surprise for a laptop geared for gaming.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a pretty decent gaming laptop. Granted, I do not have the latest games to push the limit of the laptop. But I am certain it can run most games at decent level. On the other hand, if top performance is what you need, then a laptop should not be the option to take. This is a mid-range gaming laptop. Also consider that this is more of a portable gaming PC than a laptop. At over 5lbs, this is probably better suited at LAN parties instead of sitting at a Starbucks.', 'This is a great laptop for a good price. Built quality is top notch, lots of plastic but its all very sturdy, with no flex. It uses the latest 8th gen 6 cores/12 threads intel cpu and a discrete nvidia geforce gtx 1060 Q. I can play all moderm games at 1080p at high settings (some can even at ultra settings, but with some effects dialed down).

I’ve always been “buy a computer that can play games from 5 years ago” guy. With this laptop, I went onto several “will this work” sites, and was shocked! ALL the games, including games that just barely released, were not only playable, but playable at high or ultra settings! Usually, I’d be playing on bare minimum requirements. Games like Doom or GTA would have lower resolution than a PlayStation One game. Now, all games are mine for the playing!\r\n\r\nSo far, I’ve mainly concentrated on two games... Sims 4 and my longtime guilty pleasure, GuildWars 2. Sims moves without choppy frame rates, and looks stunning. Guildwars 2 I’ve played since Beta on an old Windows 8 laptop with integrated graphics, on lowest settings. This laptop played it on ultra. The game looks totally different! Static trees and pixelated grasses have been replaced by wind rustled leaves and gently swaying grasses. I loaded a Doom demo and can’t wait to add that game to my collection! For the first time, I actually signed up for a Steam account! \r\n\r\nMy next purchase will be a 2nd harddrive for the laptop to store games. I never realized modern games were all in the 60 to 90GB size!\r\n\r\nBesides amazing graphics, this computer is insanely fast. Apps and programs load in seconds, and bootup time is around 8 to 10 seconds. It gets warm but heat is vented towards the back and never feels too hot. My only complaint is the AC plug. It only works in one plug in my house, and I have to jiggle it to charge when I plug it in at work. I’m not sure why it’s so picky. Everything else from the Nintendo Switch, iPhone, iPad, Bluetooth speakers, etc charge with no problem. Small price to pay to play every pc game I can think of!', ""This is the first dedicated gaming computer I've owned, and it is like a whole new experience! Every single aspect of using it is better than any computer before. The quick and solid response from the keys, the backlit keyboard, the speed with which programs open, the graphics quality, the sleek case, the number of peripheral ports, and on, and on, and on. \r\n\r\nI am so impressed with it, that I don't even know where to begin. I suppose the keyboard is a good place, since that is the first interaction you have with it. The individual keys have a very low profile, smoothly beveled edges, and a stronger spring than I'm used to encountering on a laptop. This helps avoid accidental keystrokes and provides great positive feedback when a key is pressed. The adjustable backlight is a very soothing blue which allows for gameplay at night without washing out the screen.\r\n\r\nIt is engineered to maximize heat dissipation, as evidenced by how infrequently the fan kicks in, and when the fan does come on, it is exponentially quieter than any laptop fan I've heard before.\r\n\r\nGraphics and speed are what you'd expect from the components used - crisp and fast - but it is the overall build quality that stays with you once you step away, and demands your attention each time you return. \r\n\r\nI would grab this computer for any type of use, not just gaming, because it performs like you always hope a computer will, even though most of them don’t."", 'The folks at Dell have done a great job selecting the components for this gaming laptop while at the same time keeping it affordable. This laptop’s performance really shows thanks to the latest 8th generation Intel i7 processor with 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 6 GB DDR5 NVIDIA GeForce 1060 graphics card and a M2 SSD with an expandable 2.5” slot for an optional HD/SSD. It does not have a DVD/CD drive however with today’s industry I don’t feel it’s necessary and there’s always an option for an external one if you need it. It handles several active programs with ease and I was able to run current quality games at a high frame rate with virtually no lag and incredible detail. I will definitely be adding another hard drive for game and file storage and possibly upgrading the RAM to 16 or 32 gigs, however I don’t feel it’s necessary or a priority for the casual gamer like myself. Games looked great on the full HD IPS display and having the HDMI port to expand to a better or second monitor is always an option. If you’re not a gamer and are in the market for a decent laptop, this should definitely be taken into consideration; the laptop is lightweight, has a very comfortable keyboard and trackpad and has more options than you’ll ever need. I read some reviews by other owners complaining of the sound of the fan and I didn’t notice it was much louder than any other gaming laptops nor have I experienced any overheating issues. A few things I didn’t care for were the fact that it doesn’t have the sporty look of a gaming laptop, which could also be a good thing depending on your view, and the sharp corners on the front end of the keyboard which can catch you on the wrist. With it’s above average specs, this laptop should hold its ground against the competition and be considered if you’re in the market for a gaming laptop or a laptop that will outperform most others at this price point.', 'This is a great gaming laptop at a reasonable price point. I’ve used Dell laptops at the office for over 10 years and this is the first “gaming” laptop I’ve had a chance to use. As with all my previous Dell computers, the quality of the system from the build to the components are top-notch. This laptop performs well thanks to the newest 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of DDR4 RAM (6 Cores/12 Threads), a 6 GB DDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 Max-Q graphics card and 256GB SSD with an expansion slot for an additional 2.5” HD/SSD.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to setup and get started. Windows 10 is pre-installed and I had it up and running within minutes. As this is a gaming-only laptop for me, I did not add many of my usual applications to this machine and have focused on using it for playing Fortnite and Overwatch. There have been no lag issues and the HD display really shines through. Keyboard is laid out well and includes a numeric keypad. Instead of the usual red graphics, Dell decided to go with blue backlighting on the keyboard and blue graphics on the lid and fan grills…pretty slick!\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n- Well built machine from the build to components – Dell does not disappoint\r\n- Fast booting with SSD drive\r\n- Support most modern games at 1080p and on high settings\r\n- Built in speakers sound great – headphone jack included\r\n- Fast SSD drive with expansion slot for additional 2.5” drive\r\n- Multiple USB 3.0 ports, HDMI port to connect to external displays or TVs\r\n- Fans work well to keep machine cool while gaming or general use – not too loud either\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n- System is a bit on the heavier side\r\n- Boxy build, although this seems to be the new normal for gaming laptops\r\n- Need to replace both RAM memory sticks if upgrading RAM\r\n\r\nOverall this is a great gaming laptop at a great price point that will be suitable for all but the most discerning gamers. It’s well built and has all the latest components. This is certainly a laptop that I would recommend to friends and family.', '')"

Basically it's the same touch pad that is in every other laptop out there right now. \n\nThe 1st) thing you notice about this Dell laptop is how bright the screen is, excellent display and very sharp colors and graphics. 2nd), is how fast it boots up. The solid state drive is great but if you are a novice you may want to think twice before purchasing any solid state because you will have to remap the destinations of some of your folders: Your download, document, videos, and so on to your D drive. You will also need to remember to install certain programs to your D drive instead of your C drive. 4th), there's more than ample space to store whatever you're in to.

While shopping and comparing on Best Buy I found several HP's of interest, but purchased this Dell 5570 Inspiron for several reasons --- and it was a really good decision to buy it!  Firstly, its faster 8th gen Intel 7 processor along with 12 gigs of RAM was really appealing, as was it's Intel graphic processor.  2.) Like my old HP I wanted an SSD and 256G was plenty of storage as I typically use cloud based services for heavier storage needs.  3.) It also comes with a built-in DVD which was a bonus that you don't see that often on new machines given all the streaming services out there.  Regardless, having the DVD built-in and using it only occasionally is a nice feature when needed.  4.)  The LED HD screen quality is excellent, IMHO, and perfect for my needs ---- despite some of the pundit reviewers dissing the screen I'm just fine with it---although it did take a few days to learn how to adjust its brightness, colors, etc.  The built-in Intel Settings are easy to access and use enabling me to set the screen to my liking----and it's just fine.  I like it!  5.)  While a bit heavier for a Laptop these days this Dell Inspiron is essentially my desktop so being able to take it with me when I need to is perfect!  At a little over 5 pounds that's not big deal at all.  Not sure about battery life, but while AirBnB'ing I also plug in anyway and have no need for long air travel tripping.  6.)

Also love the face recognition.', ""I was initially quite hesitant to pick up this computer because I had read a number of reviews - quite recent ones - stating that they had to return their computer due to frequent blue screen errors.\r\n\r\nI am here to say to corroborate this and say that this is exactly correct.\r\n\r\nIF YOU PURCHASE THIS MACHINE, YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO A BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH EVERY FEW HOURS. It is also possible you will experience checkerboard-patterned corruption and flashing/flickering of your screen.\r\n\r\nThis is of course completely unacceptable for brand new computers.\r\n\r\nI am not tech illiterate! I have also made forum posts about this issue, googled incessantly for possible fixes, and discussed the problem with AMD and with an independent computer expert.\r\n\r\nIt seems some solutions have been found by some people, but people are receiving different error codes across devices (my most common one is VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR, but I have received other ones as well).\r\n\r\nSo I would advise you to not purchase this laptop unless you desire to finagle with yours and figure it out yourself - which may turn out to be impossible or require waiting an unacceptable amount of time for a fix to be published.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the computer's features pale before this immense fault, however, I wholeheartedly love the build - I love the keyboard, I love the size and shape. The keyboard layout is optimal for the way I type - I am used to it and I love it.\r\n\r\nSo I dearly want to keep this computer - I might even be willing to put up with these problems in order to keep this computer, but if it's this glitchy now, I fear to imagine what it'll be like in just a single year.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if I cannot solve this problem to my satisfaction within the fifteen days allotted by Best Buy, I will be returning mine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I would encourage readers to consider alternatives."", 'I needed a new PC so I chose the Dell based on the many things I heard about it.

The other sends herbal info to my clients. \r\nI’m happy with its performance so far.', ""Not every Dell 2-in-1 is the same. Many have soldered RAM and can not be expanded. This 7375 is one in which you expand the RAM. Unfortunately, this particular build comes with 2x4GB modules installed, so you can not simply add 1 more 8GB module, but instead to get 16GB you would have to take out both and put in larger modules, as in 2x8GB, or you can even install 2x16GB. 9 screws and careful lifting of the bottom panel is all it takes to get in to these user-serviceable components. The USB-C does not support Thunderbolt3, but it does do DisplayPort over USB-C, so you can use a cheaper dock that passes through power and have just 1 thing to plug in giving you Ethernet, USB, Power, HDMI, etc. The hinges are sturdy. I choose and recommend this 2-in-1 often to anyone considering a Surface, due to the Surface's extremely high failure rate."", 'TL;DR - I can\'t say enough good things about this laptop. It is fast, easily expanable, reasonably small, and very inexpensive.\r\n\r\nI had a 2017 Macbook Pro that decided to fail on me. Sent it to Apple where they damaged it further during their repair and then refused to fix it (long, uninteresting story). After spending $3,200 on a laptop, I decided to take the less expensive route and try a Dell.\r\n\r\nThis laptop is simply amazing. I am a consultant in software design for the finance sector. I often bring my laptop to clients and go over code/data/etc in real time. I can easily run 3 or 4 instances of node-express, postgres, vscode, PowerPoint and Excel without any slowdown. Screen updates are super smooth, I/O is quick (apps open almost instantly), keyboard is very nice.\r\n\r\nDownsides are the short battery life, which has never been an issue even while travelling. It\'s not often I go more than 4-5 hours without an outlet these days. It\'s a little heavy for a 13"". It runs hotter than the Macbook Pro - you will notice the fan if you\'re utilizing more than 15% cpu.\r\n\r\nIt\'s $599, it feels faster than my 1 year old Macbook Pro, it takes less than 5 minutes to open up and upgrade the memory & storage. Simply amazing!', 'I really like the 13 in screen. It is very light and portable. It is also 2 N 1. This us the first time I have ever owned a Dell. This is my favorite laptop I have ever owned.', 'Hello. I usually don\'t write reviews (no time) but in this particular case I want to do my best to warn other consumers like me about this particular model, the new generation of Dell products and their service. Please, just spend a minute and read this.\r\nI bought this laptop model back in June 2018. The model almost out of the box had an issue with the WiFi card just disappearing after closing the lid or suspending the machine. Unfortunately, I wasn\'t able to return the laptop to the store within the 15 days return period (traveling). After doing some troubleshooting by myself, I decided it was time to contact Dell support. For more than a month I was working when I had time with the support technician to try to fix the problem. We went through everything, updating the drivers, disabling the power save options, updating the BIOS, you named it. So it was time to send the laptop to the Dell repair center. I sent the computer to the service repair center and it came back with the same issue OUT OF THE BOX. Total waste of time. The report said that they reinstalled the operating systems, a thing that was done before and it was clear that it is not the solution. So, after sending several emails to the technician that was following this service request, and NOT getting any answer from him, I decided to start again with Dell support. The second support agent pulled the service history and agreed that replacing the OS wasn\'t a solution (I have the chat saved on the record). He arranged to have a box sent to me to send again the computer for repair to the service center, according to him with a strong note to address the faulty components. I sent the computer and for my surprise today it came back AGAIN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OUT OF THE BOX (see images enclosed). I spent an hour today on the phone with another support agent trying to have this addressed once and for all. Turns out that Dell will not replace the computer and the solution is to keep playing this game of sending the computer to the service center. \r\nThis is not an isolated issue with mine. There have been many complains on the same problem and Dell is aware of it. Check the Dell community links (https://www.dell.com/community/Networking-Internet-Bluetooth/Disappearing-Wireless-adapter/td-p/5163491, https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/Inspiron-13-7375-Disappearing-Wireless/td-p/6065534 for example), Still Dell will not recall the model or models with this faulty hardware and keep selling them like nothing is going on. Please, if your are thinking to buy this computer, do yourself a favor, DON""T. Help us, the fellow consumers, to make Dell aware that we deserve respect and they should stop making tons of money by selling crappy products.', '')"

Battery life is very decent, especially since this is such a basic unit, it doesn't have to power all that much. Oddly enough this computer does not have a caps lock key, but if you hit ALT and the Search button on the keyboard, it turns on. Simple shortcut.
