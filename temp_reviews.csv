"Still adjusting from using Andriod/Windows.

Monitor gets fingerprints really easy. See photo.

Thus far - Still good with my move to all Apple: Iphone; IPad; IWatch and now MACBook Air!!

 Good Good Good!!!"
"Yes... I know.... I can get a windows laptop with better specs for the same price as the MacBook Air!!!! But it's not a MacBook though!!!! Coming from a 2009 MacBook Pro, which still runs really fast to this day, I just couldn't be comfortable using a windows laptop... I've tried the Acer nitro 5, Acer Predator 300, Hp envy x360 and HP spectre x360 ( which is a very awesome windows laptop by the way ) it just didn't feel the same.    It also didn't help that I'm pretty much fully invested in the Apple Eco sys.  So far my experience with the MacBook Air is pretty awesome.... yea it's not as ""fast""  as the MacBook Pro but c'mon be honest,  majority of the people getting the MacBook Pro won't be editing any photos or videos it's just going to be for basic everyday use.  Anyways it's pretty quick for a dual core Y series, touchpad is beyond great.... no windows laptop can ever come close. Sound is amazing for a 13 inch.   Also, it let's me get the newest MacBook laptop that doesn't have the touch bar... sorry but I just don't like it... imagine that thing breaking on you...call me old school I don't care.   So if you want to get the MacBook Pro go for it!!  but if you want to save some money, no Touch Bar  and get a MacBook that will fit majority of needs for everyday use get the MacBook air.  Oh, don't even worry about ""future proofing"" my ancient 2009 MacBook Pro still runs faster than some of the budget windows laptop out there... you'll be okay with this one.  =) I almost forgot... Best Buy will bundle match the apple promo. Buy a MacBook and get the beats studio 3 wireless for free... well the Best Buy that I went to does."
"Lightweight, long battery life, rapid productivity no matter what application you use...everything we love about Apple."
"I have by no means been pro apple. I just recently purchased my first Mac book- and had to go out and get another one after just a week. 
It took me a moment to understand how to beat use the book- but now I have one for home and office. 
Perfect sync to the phone I just got. 
Going from Android Fanbase to apple was not a switch I wanted - but for the cost, performance, and out of the box function- I have switched teams. 
Buttons work well, touchpad is flawless. 
Holds a steady charge. 
10/10 bought two and would buy a third if I had to."
"I was holding on to my 2010 MacBook Pro praying it wouldn't die. After the battery died, it rendered my laptop a desktop. Eventually, the computer died. I was going to purchase another MacBook Pro, but realized I didn't need it for my average usage. I purchased the MacBook Air and I LOVE it. I'm so glad I made the change. The laptop is smaller, lightweight, and a joy use. It does what I need at speeds that still amaze me (remember, I'm coming from a 2010 MacBook Pro). This was a well appreciated purchase."
"I have had trouble with all other brands of computers and have finally found a great one with Apple. It runs amazing, even with multiple windows or applications open. The tracking and serve is super fast and efficient and the battery will last for multiple days with moderate usage. This is a great computer for all usage, but I especially love it as a college student since all of my contacts, messages, documents and applications is available on all of my products now (phone and computer)."
